1,But why Bollywood? Are you punishing us for keeping even the tiniest hope that Bollywood might improve?,"Animal is classic Bollywood garbage-rife with misogyny and senseless plot twists. The film lacks a cohesive storyline, drowning in a sea of unnecessary turns. What's truly entertaining is sifting through the suspicious 10/10 ratings. It becomes a game to spot the paid or bot-generated reviews, making this detective work more enjoyable than enduring the movie itself. In the realm of Bollywood disappointments, this movie serves as a reminder of the challenges in Bollywood filmmaking, where lackluster plots, an abundance of unnecessary twists, and a distressing dose of misogyny can overshadow any cinematic potential.",negative
1,Horrible! Yuck!,"After watching this movie, the only feeling that comes to mind is Yuck! This Venga way of story telling disgusts me as a viewer. One after one, this kind of movie is released by Venga, this one is no exception. This is toxic screenplay is torture to mind and eye of viewer. It has insane cruelty, misconduct, abuse that gives you yuckky feeling in 95% of the movie. I can not believe people spent so much money to watch this movie on theater, again proves the fact that nasty and filthy things still sold at a hight price in market. It is one time watch and are not worth watching again. Even OTT web series has more validity as a story than this movie. The most hyped movie which is a long screenplay but does not have any actual story to watch. Completely rejected!!!",negative
1,Such a shame for even animals to name this movie,"Ranbir personal show with no story, no logic and absurd action scenes. Anil Kapoor and boby are wasted totally, the film story is from the age where there are no law and enforcement exists you can do whatever you want to either it's your own country or you are in foreign kill as many people as want .... to make a century of corpses is like a piece of cake. Zero emotions and no chemistry between father and son....not even close to a worst family drama and yes it's not a family movie strong language lot of unwanted smooching and obscenity. Spend 3.5 hrs with your father or if you are father spend quality time with your son and save yourself from this disaster.",negative
2,Ew! Wtf is this?,"Let us not talk about mysogyny in the movie because that has been said a number of time, which btw is very true. But besides that, the dialogues, the plot, the acting, everything seems to be missing in the movie.Rashmika should NEVER try to speak in hindi. She mumbles a lot and sometimes it looks like her jaw is frozen. I don't know why she was casted in this movie. Her acting is REALLY REALLY bad and her character has ABSOLUTELY no self respect in the movie. Women in the movie are just props, like any other Vanga movie. Ranbir's acting is good. There is violence in the movie but I do not mind that unless there is justification for it or if it is done sensibly. Here, it is done just for the sake of it.",negative
1,Probably the worst movie I've ever seen,"You seriously need to question the sanity of the director, producers and even the actors of this film. I'm a bit traumatized by the movie, and Ive seen my fair share of gore. This movie was beyond bad. And the storyline defies logic which makes it even worse. Too many instances where basic questions and clarity in communication would've reduced the screen time from three hours to two hours max. The worst part is the director is planning on a sequel soon.If you value your hard earned money and your mental health, I would advise you to abstain from watching this 3 and a half hour torture of a film.",negative
1,A movie praising misogyny,"Bollywood as usual à man's world. The clear success of this shows how toxic the thought of viewers and the industry. Misogyny praised, cheating normalised. Just a garbage storyline put into together just to satisfy some men and fantasy of the director.From begining till the end, it normalized cheating by men, disrespect to women etc. The director clealry showed his disrespect towards women in life and showed unrealistic and unmatched masculity through raw sex scenes and violence.Movie is sickening to its core and breaks the society even more to disrespect women.Tried to imitate a bad version of bdsm movie like fifty shades of grey but conveyed very dark.",negative
1,not a movie but a cancer,"I would have given negative star if there would have been any option for that. This is a movie of the animal, for the animal and by the animal. Its just like a cancer which grows slowly inside your mind.Talking about film I feel that showing physopath character would have been justified if you prove that character to be wrong at the end of the movie. But it was opposite and proved him to be a macho man of what he has done. Sandeep Sir I must say you or directors like you are already sick. Hence, your films are a cancer for our societies.Talking about some of the fans, you also feel somewhere powerless in your life or feel like I am being oppressed under someone who is ruling or exploiting me. In this case, a revenge thought process develops inside your mind very slowly which in result reflects in such a way that when you starts watching these kind of gore/violence genre movies, you start loving all of that whether how much of gore scenes is being shown because you start feeling like yes this is me, this is my character and I also would have done this for taking revenge if I would have got chance. Your love towards violence genre goes to that much of extent that you even slam or backfires at those like me who criticizes these movies. But honestly speaking this is not your fault. To overcome this you must follow those sources which not only helps to make your mind stable and peaceful but also helps to spread good message for others.True famous quote-'Your brain is not a dustbin, respect that and consume healthy thoughts'.",negative
1,Nauseating,"Well, don't know what to write. Was not able to watch the movie.I am just wondering, if we should learn about the taste of the audience from the ratings here. How on earth an uncivilised, uncultured, nauseating movie can get 10 / 10 rating.My head hangs in shame when a movie like Animal is a hit.Have a suggestion to the audience who liked this movie, instead of imagining yourself as the Ranbir / Bobby imagine someone else as Ranbir / Bobby. This should give some perspective.Have a question for the director, what are you making ? Do you call it a form of art / creation ? I am wondering what type of sick people can direct, act in these types of movies.Before these actors, directors starts making the next movie, get yourself checked for mental illnesses because if untreated, can be harmful to society.",negative
1,This garbage glorifies school shooting enough said,"Complete garbage, glorifies school shooting, objectifying women, toxic realtionships, unstable personalities, degrading of mental health professionals.Any sensible person can not give this movie a great review, really please get a mental evaluation if you like the movie.How is a young student going with gun and shooting in college a glorifies thing now, when a whole country is suffering from such an endemic situation (US)?How is being toxic in a relationship and using sex as solution a glorified situation?How is the concept of alpha and idiots joining up for pride of family committing crime a glorifies situation?Beyond all these, massive, gigantic, colossal holes in plots and poorly developed characters. Honestly, the kind of garbage sometimes Bollywood produces is amazing, knowing that they have produced amazing works in similar vein like Gangs of wasseypur etc.... not even in same zip code these movies if they are trying to capture violence between two family and emotions for revenge...",negative
4,Disappointing,"""Animal,"" directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, offers a captivating experience with impressive background music, memorable songs, and technical finesse. However, the film stumbles in terms of story strength and screenplay execution, featuring temporal shifts that lack coherence and fail to enhance the narrative.While the first half engages with its fast pace, the second half unnecessarily prolongs the story, leaving the film feeling overly lengthy and lacking character development, especially with Ranbir Kapoor's character. His abrupt temporal shifts lack clear reasoning, contributing to a disjointed narrative.Despite a touching emotional scene between Anil Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor towards the end, it arrives too late, leaving the audience fatigued and eager for closure. The credit scenes, though appealing, add to the film's unnecessary length.Ranbir Kapoor's character, portrayed as a hero, raises concerns due to his criminal actions, lack of respect for others, blatant misogyny, and attitude problems. The film's attempt to celebrate such a character is problematic, as it glorifies a man-child who in reality needs therapy.Actress Rashmika Mandanna's performance is very poor, making her unfit for the role. She was struggling to deliver convincing dialogue and lacked depth in her portrayal.It's disheartening to witness Bollywood failing with films like ""Animal."" The industry has the potential for impactful cinema but seems to fall for subpar narratives. They should strive for better storytelling and more nuanced character portrayals and should avoid the pitfalls of glorifying problematic characters for the sake of entertainment.",negative
5,Such movies at 600 Cr so far.... What are we up to.,"Such a bogus movie at 600 cr. What are we up to? We have Sam bahadur and kadak singh in parallel which not even able to manage 100 cr.Basically people want drugs over ghee is such a true analogy. Sad but truth..
There is only violence and bad story in animal which you can't even ask your family to watch.I am against any boycotting but Indian cinema needs to come out of the 'break the skull with hammer' approach. In fact bollywood is now not able to make their own script or movies so no they are copying South Indian movies.Jawan was good movie but what was there in Tiger3(total waste).We need good movies with stories, acting, songs...",negative
1,Worst ever movie!,"When we make a female lead movie, everyone labels it as a feminist movie. But even then those movies just portray how a woman challenges society and comes forward in life. Society can't accept even that and rates the movie so low. Then what about this nonsense movie. Is this not a misogynist movie. How many movies like this are shown to insult women and objectify them. Why is no one labelling such movies as misogynist when it actually is. Why are we still showing women as objects in such kind of movies. What is it with movies like Kabir Singh and Animal. This movie is so disgusting, it shows how ranbir is in real life. Look at the movies alia chooses and look at the movies this useless fellow chooses. He either chooses a playboy movie or a movie where he objectifies women. Poor alia to be married to such a misogynist.",negative
1,SHAM ON THE ENTIRE CREW,"It is a shame on animals to name this movie after them because they are much well mannered and civilized then this movies characters, Director, producer and specially dialog writer.Shame on Anil Kapoor, Ranbir japoor, Bobby deol to accept to act in this third class movie. I am amazed at the people who gave this movie a good review and can imagine how sick thier mentality could be. Spare your young adults from watching this filth, You'll be uncomfortable even to watch this movie alone!! Shame on Rashmika to accept this movie, I can understand her desperation to work in hindi movies but where is your dignity as a woman??There is height of cheap and vulgar dialogs that too unnecessarily!!! Unnecessary vulgar scanes.I am so amazed at Ranbir kapoor to even agreeing to deliver the dialogs the writer gave him. So so disrespectful towards father and wife.There is not one thing good about this movie, only filthy minds can watch and praise this movie.",negative
1,Worst movie I have ever seen in my life. BOSTAPOCHA!,"I, being a movie lover, have watched a couple thousand movies at this point, ranging from English to Hindi to Korean to German to Tamil to Telegu to Bengali to French. And I can confidently say that ANIMAL is officially the worse movie that I have ever seen in my life. I ama amazed how movies like these end up being a blockbuster that too in 2024. It's a terrible movie full of false male stigma, oversaturatedly glorified manhood and sex. Nobody should watch the movie ever. Such a terrible and shameless director and his rotten movie plot!! Regretting spending 200 minutes of my life on this terrible movie. 0/10.",negative
1,What was this cringe fest? High budget C grade movie. -10/10,"Why has this movie been made. No storyline, lots of gore & embarassment. Who are these people rating this garbage so high. Males will have a harder time with their wives and families watching this movie make a mockery of the word Alpha and generic male population will be verbally bashed as psycho, since this animal here has been portrayed as a hero. And wait, there is no storyline. Incompetent directors bank on unnecessary violence to make money. So go to the theatres to make money for incompetent director/ producer. No self respecting male would go to watch this movie with anyone they know. There should be a provision to counter these paid high rankings with negative rankings. I am not happy with 1.",negative
1,Too long!!,"After the long wait, my friends and I went to the morning show of this movie, and the theater was packed. I was excited to watch it because I liked the trailer, but despite the interesting first half and a great scene before intermission, the entire cast started doing nonsensical things after the break. It seemed like the director instructed them to do anything imaginable to bore the audience until the climax scene, which was somewhat good. Despite the cast's performances, I found this movie extremely skippable. Rashmika was improving, Bobby Deol deserved more screen time, and Ranbir Kapoor's performance deserved a better film. Overall, it's not worth your time. While the background music makes it somewhat watchable, I still recommend skipping it. You might as well go to the zoo and watch a real animal; you'll be done in 1-2 hours, rather than spending more than almost 3 hours and 30 minutes watching this unnecessarily violent, misogynist, low on story cheap adult film with mediocre action and far too many nonsense scenes.",negative
1,Toxic,"I dont think I have felt so enraged after watching a movie. Prominent figures, especially actors in a country where movies have so much impact on the population, should behave with certain social responsibilities. With absolutely no story, and such ill treatment of people (especially women), there is no scope to appreciate any creative angle. Just naming the movie ""Animal"" does not justify validating the excessive misogyny, elitism and narcissism. Also there is a line to where it gets excessive, but that was crossed way back and you still have to sit through the movie which could have ended at intermission.Hating the fact that this movie is getting a good opening and could have a sequel. *puke*",negative
3,An Unrestrained Trashfire.,"If you squint, you can kind of see where Sandeep Venga's Animal is supposed to go. It's a character study about an unhinged man born into privilege but lacking in the most important qualities, obsessed with his father who never showed him the love he needed. He's drawn into a world of violence and crime, in a desperate attempt to impress him. That's an interesting concept; throw in some of the Successionesque business politics, and you could've had an incredible film. The movie certainly has the talented names - Ranbir Kapoor, Anil Kappor, Bobby Deol - to make it work.Yet, Animal fails on basically every level. It feels like the creation of an annoying 14 year old Indian boy than a film, and can only be described as TOO MUCH. This 3 hour and 24 minutes feels like an eternity as we zip from scene to scene, moment to moment, without much time to breathe. Not to mention, the film just feels excessive and it's not entertaining. It's honestly an exhausting affair.TOO MUCH brutality and gore. It's completely unnecessary, off putting, and difficult to watch. We're supposed to like our protagonist (more on him later), yet he's needlessly cruel and violent, like everyone at a certain point in this film. It feels really ""off"" tonally, and comes out of nowhere. The scene where Bobby Deol was introduced started off nicely, but then goes off the rails with the blood and gore, and it ruins it completely. Not to mention the unnecessary...sex scene. Yeah. More on THIS later too.Ranbir Kapoor's Vijay is a psychopath, who is as mentioned before, cruel and violent, but unstable, rude, callous, condescending, misogynistic, and difficult to empathize with. We have to spend a bulk of the film with this man, and the movie is constantly asking us to sympathize and respect him, but he deserves none of it. I like films with ""unlikable"" protagonists, but a film has to give us a reason to connect with them from time to time. I don't want to hear anyone complain about Leo's Jordan Belfort ever again; a guy we know is terrible, but you can't help but like him. Vijay is not that.The film is supposed to be about who is trying to kill Anil Kapoor's Papa (that's not his real name, but it might as well be, and to be fair, he's really good in this), and lead us into some corporate and maybe political intrigue. But the film wastes it with a paper thin, poorly told plot and villain's whose performers give it their all and are compelling via performance, but definitely terribly written. They're two dimensional and their motives feel rushed, and not to mention, the film can't help but be a bit Islamophobic as well. (There's subtext to these Modi era Bollywood movies).But frankly, the worst thing about this movie is its celebration of toxic masculinity and misogyny. I'm no Bechdel Test wielding feminist, but my God, this movie really hates women. They're either doeish sex objects or lack any agency at all. There's a really dark and twisted attitude towards sex and relationships this movie portrays, glorifying domination, fear, and abuse, all whilst desperately trying to convince us the main couple have a happy and successful marriage. Vijay can't help but undermine and demean every other woman he sees, treating them as sexual objects, intimidating them, or insulting them. And what's disturbing is the movie seems to want to paint him as ""the man men want to be, and the man women want to date.""There's legitimately a stretch of this film towards the end where I genuinely worried we'd see explicit violence against women, like some wife slapping or choking or worse, SA or the R word. I'm not joking. I saw this with three women. You can imagine how they felt.Yeah, I'd maybe watch this high and laugh at with friends again, but for anyone else, PLEASE avoid this trashfire.",negative
2,"Overhyped, objectifying woman and Muslims character assassination.","First of all, if they were cousins, why in the world it was shown that cousins were turned Muslims and became like this.Secondly, if the business was distributed evenly, there would have been no enmity.Thirdly, where is police and law enforcement ??????Fourth, can a man fight with 200 persons with an axe ??? Seems funny though.At the end of the film, a person will feel disgusting, it's better to watch a movie like 12th fail or hi pappa (hi nanna) rather than wasting time on such hatred movies like animal or fighterWhat are the directors smoking nowadays ???Is there any logic or sense in this movie.Total waste of time.",negative
1,Wasted my time,"Don't waste your time. Hopeless movie with too much toxic masculinity! Slapping between couples is glamorized. Total nonsense. Ranbir Kapoor's character is clearly full of toxicity. The movie is low on substance and clearly, all the protagonist wants is validation and goes on a killing spree just to prove it. Clearly, Ranbir Kapoor is mentally sick and all is justified in the name of saving the father. Utter nonsense. I don't know who they are copying - Godfather or scarface or Kill Bill. ""Sadly it's a man's world"", Vijay says to his wife in a scene"", need not say more about the inherent sexism.",negative
2,Absolute trash.,"Animal is trash - as a movie. Forget the sexism, misogyny or other social parameters, from the point of view of movie making - it is simply trash. Director Vanga doesn't know how to portray - relied only on cheesy dialogues and useless repetitive fight scenes and illogical violence. Scenes seemed forced - someone trying to force down violence through rice tube.This lack of coherent storytelling not only disengages the viewer but also detracts from any profound commentary the film aspires to make about the human condition.Vangha's directorial approach is lamentably misguided, showcasing a stark inability to navigate the complex terrain of human psychology with any semblance of subtlety or depth.The characters are nothing more than hollow caricatures, trapped in a cycle of repetitive and senseless brutality that serves no narrative purpose other than to shock and repulse. This incessant glorification of violence comes off as a desperate grasp for edginess, stripping the film of any potential for genuine emotional resonance or intellectual engagement.",negative
1,Boring,"Everyone told me that the action is great!I watched the movie and I was just sitting waiting for the actions.Actions may have been mounted to extra and bloody, but that movie is annoying.It's plain boring. There's no story, just a stubborn guy who has a mental problem roaming around doing what he wants. And turns out that guy is the protagonist of the film.It is so weird how people are celebrating such madness. Some people are actually laughing to nonsense jokes in the movie.Turns out not all people like it. Tons of people hate the movie too.Waste of time. Forget about whether things are toxic or not, the movie is pure boredomness.",negative
1,Toxic gore,"I dont think I have felt so disturbed after watching a movie.

I don't understand who are these people rating the movie so highly, or are they trying appease one and other! Someone has to be real psycho to appreciate a movie of this gore or there is scope to buy ratings, they audience will lose faith in ratings.",negative
3,Animal without teeth,"All bark and no bite. That's the point of the movie Animal in 5 words. When you sit down in the theatre to experience the much hyped, one of best movies of 2023 and receive randomized, unnecessary scenes in the name of extravagant cinema, you feel let down and cheated.Sure, there's a lot of action, violence, gore, anger that people may not have seen before in a state side movie. But if it doesn't relate to the story, the characters of the movie and most importantly the emotions of the film, it feels like you have been cheated out of 3hrs 21mins of your precious time and money. So behold, something you dont understand, you dont like and yet, you will spend money on it. Sad and shameful. The only saving grace of the movie is Bobby deol.",negative
1,Distarous & Boring,"I wish I could give minus 10 for this disaster movie ! In Short this movie is a 1972 classic Godfather wannabe but in Desi chapri style targeted for uneducated Indians, for real if you have a good taste & you have watched decent Hollywood Action flicks you will feel like torture watching this tedious 3 hr long movie. Even recent Bollywood actions like War & Tiger 3 are way better that this garbage,I have no clue how this movie became blockbuster. There is no story no good action no depth & no character development by any of the actors , Anil Kapoor was the only one watchable beside him there is no one worthy. Good luck.",negative
1,Atrocious Disaster,"This movie is such an atrocious movie. The poorest of the scripts in recent years. Ranbir Kapoor is definitely an over hyped actor. Unnecessary the movie has been exaggerated for so long. Ranbir Kapoor looks weird in macho in fight seen. He definitely is not meant for these kind of such scenes. A time when movies of 2 hours seem to be too long without a good script, this movie is a torture for three hours 20 minutes. This fiction has miserably failed to create a positive impression and convey any message to the society. Ranbir looks psycho is his character and so in his acting, too many unnecessary characters in the movie has made it a big failure.",negative
1,Horrendous,"This is the worst movie ever made. The idea was to gather as much nonsense as possible and just throw it in a pot. After eating the abomination that's been cooked, just release it from the rear end. And then feed what comes out to the less than intelligent people who were suckered into watching this garbage in its entirety. How this movie was produced and who in their right mind agreed to finance this trash needs to have a thorough mental examination. Then have them all instituted and made to watch this movie on a loop in their confinement. It's just as painful to write this review as it must've been for the people who saw this movie.",negative
7,This Animal is exceptionally brilliant but needs a team of psychologists to cure him,"This is surely one of the best movies that bollywood has produced in the last 10 years in terms of entertainment. All things from storyline to music and from action scenes to quality of acting are brilliantly planned and executed. Even though the running time of the movie is almost 3.5 hours you actually don't feel its length.RK has really nailed it this time. This performance can be surely counted as one of his very best in terms of quality of acting. As much as I want to say the same thing for Rashmika, the element of common sense is simply not allowing me. Firstly, the quality of acting displayed by her is disappointing compared to her previous performances. And further I am still not able to understand why someone like her accepted the movie after reading the script.(may be due to RK). The character she plays feels like a clown in the movie.The adult scenes in the movie were forcefully forced into the script and felt very unnatural. The first half of the movie is the most striking and impressive aspect, but sadly it starts to lose momentum every minute in the second half. Unnecessary and untimely placement of songs further declines the experience. The movie deviates from its original plot & theme several times which can be frustrating. Another frustrating part is that several dialogues in English and punjabi language are said so fast that 90% of audience fails to digest them. Lack of twists and turns makes it boring at times. Boby deols screen time is not more than 25 minutes, and that too without a single dialouge, which is again disappointing and surprising because the trailer of the movie makes him look like one of the leads.But all things said, we cannot deny the fact that it is something very fresh and unique, which the audience will love. One of the most aesthetically appealing & enjoyable movie from Bollywood in long time. The message it delivers between a father and son is very beautiful and climax makes up for all the faults it has.Purely a theatre movie will not be that satisfying if witnessed on mobile or laptop.",positive
1,Overall waste of time,"I watched the movie on Netflix and not in a movie theatre, so thankful that I didn't waste the money on the tickets. I could watch for some time, probably the first hour, it was difficult to keep going after that. Acting is good but the story line is so poor. I also happened to watch one of the interviews of the director where he mentions that it's okay to slap and use cuss words in a relationship and felt that he has some seriously sick ideas and a misogynistic point of view. If people with such ideas make movies, they will always end up glorifying incorrect behaviour in their movies and eventually have a bad influence on the society. It's not that you always have to show the positive side. You do need to show negative side too, but only when needed and it should be portrayed in the right way and shouldn't be glorified.",negative
8,Absolute wild animal,"Man. Ranbeer kapoor, and his pind brothers, what a lit and elite squad. Absolutely run havon in the city.Vanga simply says it bluntly on everyones face, i will dare to do what i want and show what i want and he has done that.Vangas vision is completely fulfilled by ranbeer and all other actors. Movie becomes little boring in 2nd half. But the finale is good. It is about the real man to man fight.Am still in awe of ranbeers role. This is his best acting till date. Kudos to all. Rashmika did grt in her part as well as anil kapoor. Bobby has also done good. This is a must watch theater exprnc.",positive
1,C grade movie,"Ranbir Kapoor had to be pretty desperate to sign up for such a B-grade script. This is like the old B-grade Mithun movies -- revenge storyline, plenty of violence and women being shown their ""proper"" place. Merely tagging on a father-son conflict, adding some raw dialogs and getting an A-lister to play the protagonist does not elevate a movie from B-grade to A-grade. Of course, people with a certain mentality enjoy this kind of stuff -- no doubt it will mint obscene money.Some of the reviewers here are saying it is pathbreaking etc -- pathbreaking for what? For making B-grade mainstream? About Ranbir's acting: nothing great.. over acting and over shouting.. (Ahem as befits a B-grade movie). Also beats me why a talented actress like Tripti would agree to be a part of such a regressive movie.",negative
10,The craziest and the most badass Indian movie,"Animal- The craziest and the most badass Indian movie that will ever be experienced by the audience on the screen so far since 110 years. Definitely falls under ""The Cult"" category.The boldest director Sandeep Vanga Reddy takes us through the journey of a Son's possessiveness towards his Dad to the volcanic extreme, that he is just replacing love with vengeance, peace with war, gentleness with rage and saneness with madness.Most of the scenes are original and never seen before.Ranbir Kapoor stuns you with the most complex character, and your jaw will be dropped with shock and awe for his mind boggling acting along with various emotions stampede. He just tears open the cinema screen with his brilliance and ease, as he transforms from a raging teenager to animal man, and there is no stopping even with a meteor.This marks him as the best actor of Indian cinema with a launchpad to reach the elites.Having to match him is no easy feat but Rashmika Mandanna does it elegantly with stubbornness and guts.Anil Kapoor is a class apart with his stature and maturity.Bobby Deol is back with a bang. He delivers his career best performance although his screen presence is very short (a bit disappointing).The story is uniquely presented with full heart and woven really well with astounding screenplay and terrific music.Strictly for 18+ years. The alpha man kicks in, with no good social message. Pure violence, rampage and massacre in parts.Wish some uncomfortable scenes were edited, and also movie duration trimmed (first part of second half) as its 3 hours 22 mins long.Animal movie cracks open the movie industry with the boldness and crookedness, and roars loud.Watch at your own risk!",positive

9,Sandeep literally challenged the status quo and won over,"Simply put it's a masterpiece !The Director literally put his heart in this one, the complex relationship of Father and Son explained in a such a manner. I don't feel anyone ever dared to take such a step in Indian cinema. I literally enjoyed every minute of the movie it felt so realistic at times. Ranbir finally gave a great performance after Sanju!I mean just look at the facts Sandeep made 200+mins movie which means fewer shows plus he made it adult for it to be raw and as real as possible both these things require guts everyone told me to cut the movie down and make it U/A but I am so glad he didn't.Indian cinema these days have become very typical, like at times being a movie lover I find it difficult to understand that why are our writers and directors not being creative or trying something new/ different/ interesting.But finally we are seeing creative movies and trust me the background score, Acting, music, costumes everything was just wow !And I know there will be people who might find this movie too bold, too strong, lengthy and violent. I don't oppose to such things I just feel we should appreciate that atleast someone tried to break the status quo and make such a bold movie.",positive
1,Insanely Bad Movie,"What a disastrous movie, this movie isn't suited for our Indian culture and traditions! Extreme and exceeded adult content with bed and lots of lip lock scenes, also filled with lust and double meaning dialogues.! These kind of movies affect the youth and masses a lot and leads to commit crimes, i feel shame for having this kind of psycho directors in my telugu state, who don't respect our culture and never think of the youth and effect of these kind of movies on the society..He has done his film course in Australia as he told in a show but, he shouldn't rub his insanity on our people! He might fit for foreign movies but not for Indian cinema, i don't know how the sensor board allowed such nasty and vulgar scenes with offensive dialogues!? May be they bribed them, anything can possible in India with money thats our fate..I felt ashamed while watching alone whenever the lead characters think of sex and starts a conversation and do so, as two unknown young girls were sat next to me in theatre.. Many couples and youngsters has come to watch the movie may be by thinking that this is an action and drama movie, you can't watch this movie with your any family member..Now a days some of the directors are going beyond the limits for the attention of the youth and masses to make money by leaving the ethics and values.. If there were no adult content and unnecessary scenes and kisses, this movie would have been a blockbuster..!Don't spoil the young, future generations and also our culture, traditions for the sake of money...",negative
1,Wahiyat Overrated slow lengthy Cringe,"Seriously I hate to all those people who are hyping this overrated movie over social media there is nothing special in this movie .this should have been a web series but they put into a movies which is very slow ,lengthy and over dramatic action sequence... Where actor is fighting with 200 people and their friends singing in group to cheer him up. So many unnecessary scene has been added with a very lengthy,slow and boring conversations.This movie could have ended in 2 hour but they extended with 3 hours 27 minutes unnecessary one and half hour the added I don't know why what was in their mind it wasn't needed... I was getting really bored boil watching in theatre.I am really pissed that people over social media are hyping these movie don't know why does nothing in this movie I was hoping to end to get the hell out from the theatre I got so much bored... This is first time in my life that I watched a very boring and bad film in the theatre this is the worst experience in my life never had watched this kind of movie in theatre....
This will be the only movie which I will regret forever to watch in a theatre....",negative
1,Rubbish film,"Poor story telling. Anti Muslim rhetoric. Anti common sense rhetoric. Fighting made no sense. Plot made no sense. Godfather wannabe rubbish. Whoever made this film should do some serious introspection. Utter garbage of a film. I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Not a sintella of common sense. The WHY of Ranbir kapoor was so weak. The guy had father issues. Lol. Every other kid has father issues, they don't turn into a psycho. Bruh. His father was mean to him so he developed super strength and a really strong will. No character arc. Absolute garbage. If I were in any part involved in the making of this film. I'd mostly do some serious self reflection and possibly consider a career change.",negative
7,A FATHER SON TALE CARVED IN BLOOD,"Ranbir Kapoor's introduction as a ""superstar"" in the film initially raised skepticism for me. However, as I reached the halfway point, it became evident that he truly deserved the title.Sandeep Reddy Vanga's promise to showcase genuine violence in cinema was effectively fulfilled. In an era dominated by high-budget action films and contrived flashbacks, Vanga dared to create a world where everything is heightened to the maximum, making the violence seem normal and the behavior even more unsettling. One particularly striking scene involves Ranbir, who, after discovering a mole, compels the individual to lick his shoe as a bizarre demonstration of love. It's a level of intensity reminiscent of something Quentin Tarantino might appreciate.Addressing the question of logic, it's acknowledged that the film, like many others, is inherently illogical. Drawing parallels with films like Vikram, KGF, and Bahubali, it's recognized that crafting a movie with absolute logical coherence is a formidable challenge.However, the film does have its drawbacks. The character arcs of certain individuals, such as the mother, sister, and villain, felt underdeveloped. The hero's revenge arc could have benefited from more nuanced writing, and Rashmika's character, while an improvement from Vanga's previous works, still warranted additional depth.In summary, while I wouldn't classify it as a masterpiece, the film has its merits, particularly in exploring the dynamics of father-son and husband-wife relationships alongside the intense action sequences. It's a unique cinematic experience that some may appreciate for its visceral yet somewhat polarizing elements.",positive
6,Worth one time watch but not for weak hearted and feminists,"Acting, cinematography, violence, rawness, brutality everything is fine....But the story logic doesn't work for me at all....What's the point of the movie that the director wanted to make!!!??Why would a son have so much love for his father for whom he can destroy the entire world but his father treats him with no care, doesn't give any time....yet for him he is the best father in the world.....not possible in reality....And it's too much hero-oriented film..... everything happens with no reason but bcoz hero wants it.....you don't have any connection with your kins for 20 years and all of a sudden ranbir went to ask for help to them as bodyguards and they agree giving up all their jobs... isn't that ridiculous....I can't connect with the attitude and point director tried to make with the movie.",negative
1,Why God? Why?,"I have wasted 2 hours of my life trying to watch this movie but couldn't complete it. Utter nonsense, no practical thoughts, people singing before starting a fight, one man fighting with 120 people alone and winning, father of all regular idiotic staffs observed in South movies. The Director should be immediately banned from making these weird movies like Arjun Reddy, Kabir Singh, Animal. What a waste of money and resources every time he makes movies ! Why is he even allowed to direct movies in the first place? Doesn't he get tired of making these stereotype nonsense egoistic sadistic and time wasting movies?",negative
1,Garbage wrapped in silver,"I fell into the trap of the good reviews, and wasted 4 hrs of my life. If you're reading this, save yourself.Although, Anil Kapoor and Bonny Deol bring their charms to the screen but sadly all wasted. The typical garbage story line of bollywood cash mill overshadowed everything. The movie tried to be too much, but left the essentials ie. The damn story, realism, and a cohesive plot.I can't list down all the character flaws in the Ranbir's role (although I did like his acting - just that this specific character wasn't worth it), but that's what all the movie is about. Incidentally, the writers didn't realise that they basically made the character clinically insane, but tried to add bolywood romanticism to it to no avail...My sincere recommendation is to save your time and watch 2 old classics in the same time.",negative
3,...,"Even 3 is pushing it. This was so bad I'm beginning to doubt i watched a different movie than what everyone else is describing. What a downgrade from kabir singh. They wasted so much time on random stuff, more than 3 hours and here i am asking myself every second when will the ""story"" kick in but it feels like they forgot to do that or add depth to the characters; and I'm not a person who looks for a ""purpose"" in every movie that is really not my point when i say there wasn't anything going on i really mean there was nothing. Nothing feels natural, the quirkiness, the edginess, none of it was really delivered.",negative
1,"Anil kapor, ranbir Kapoor and tripti dmry killed it. But plot was extremely bad","Acting wise fantastic, story wise it is completely disastrous. Half plot was copied from the Godfather film. The director is a cheater, he promised us the violence but film was lethargic. They cropped the real graphics scene. When ever there is a killing scene they cropped the graphics scene. And that machine gun sequence was pathetic. They should have shown the real impact of what happened when the 50 bmg bullet hit the real human body, like they showed it in rambo 2008 movie. But the acting part are damn good. Anil Kapoor what a actor, Ranbir Kapoor brilliant, and tripti dmry was also so good.",negative
1,Shameless display of sado machocism and unappetizing violence,"A week daily soap plot stretched to create an unbelievable and unappetizing saga of violence and sado machocism. A story that is so old, which is practically irrelevant in today's world. The sado machocism is Sandeep Reddy Vanga's speciality. He shamelessly showcased it in Kabir Singh and now showing it here. What one thing was beyond tolerance was especially the behaviour of the male protagonist with females. Most people condemned his behaviour with his wife or girlfriend. But for me, the most intolerable behaviour was with the househelps. That is beyond acceptable. Also censor board should not pass movies which kind of encourages domestic abuse.",negative
1,Why do they even bother paying the scriptwriters,"3+ hour's of worthless screen time with unhealthy fatherly obsession.These mainstream actors can neither speak english nor their mother tongue properly.Hindi bhi inhe foreign accent ke sath bolni hai.Everyone sounds so fake.Why try to copy western aspects of living and integrate them with such a horribly written classic indian plot.Main character is egoistic & irritatingly creepy with poor development.Concepts like beating of a child by his teacher, who's apparently supposed to be the son of the most powerful businessman, is portrayed as if he's enrolled in a local government school.Revenge of sister's ragging is south cinema like, dialogues like atmanirbhar bhaarat feels like a promotion, weird songs with every (unrealistic)battle scene, not to forget the final fight
followed by the ultimate father son confrontation.... everything is cringe from start to finish.",negative
5,Mindless voilence !! No story at all !!,"Film Review: Animal screening in theatres!!OMG !! I can't believe I went and watched this film in the theatre!!Sab critics jinhone 4 aur 5 star ratings di hain .. sab chor hain !! Aur audiences, jinhe yeh film acchi lagi .. mashallah.. bahut khoob !!The film starts off well .. but once the violence starts just before the interval, it just doesn't end ! Aise lagta hai ki voilence ke beech main scenes daalke film banayi gayi hai !!Ranbir Singh's performance and full on energy are the only plus points of the film .. everyone else including Anil Kapoor have very little to do. Rashmika Mandana looks like a glorified Bhagyashree !!Bobby's character, though good, unfortunately has very less screen time !!There is an interesting scene after the end credits roll which sets the tone for the sequel - Animal Park.... hallelujah.. may the lord save us all !!!Watch only at the risk of losing ur sanity !!Janhit main jaari

3,"Not a movie, a shouting competition","As a fan of gore and dark noir went with loads of expectations- first half was off to a near flawless flight but then the tailspin which began post-interval took down the whole movie.Excellent BGM, magnificient cinematography and out of the world acting by Ranbir (what a brilliant actor he is!) fell short to save the movie ridden with lack of depth and emotion in the storyline. The loosely written plotlines and characters severely dilapitated Ranbir's character as well because the other characters were so underdeveloped. Lack of motive in even the central character resulted in a lack of conviction in the whole story to such a level that after taking in so much of grandly choreographed violence, one is left scratching head wondering everything happened for what exactly! Emotion got translated i nto only one sided shouting and the viewer is left alone to experience an exhausting and frantic TV debate show where only the TV anchor gets to shout.Severe formula plotpoints and scenes , some of which are inspired from Godfather,OldBoy(2003), The man from Nowhere (2010) Rajneeti and even Kabir Singh were put together in such a way that one is left doubting whether the director wanted to copy from his own previous success just because it worked earlier. But it didn't result in anything like Kabir Singh because everything was so incoherent. The brilliant opening of the movie, by the director's own obcession of using pointless violence (or might be a desperate attempt to cover up the flaws in storyline) got reduced into one and only point- who can shout the loudest! Or thats what a predatory animal is supposed to do- a non-human who shouldn't be part of humane society but gets occassionally breaded by our society. It emanates an excruciatingly agonizing world around it; unable to love, empathize, dialogue & sense of integrity but is just filled with suffocating anger & treachery.",negative
1,Pathetic!!,"I'm not sure how did this even pass censor board. What is the movie even trying to portray - violence, killing, infidelity? Is this really the message to be sent to the current generation? How come commercial actors even agree to act such roles - for awards or money? It is disgusting to see Bollywood reach this stage. There is not one meaningful message in this movie. Sorry to see Ranbir and Bobby deol even take up this role. I'm sure as both of them were having a dry spell in their careers they took this long shot. A humble request is to not show even a part of it to your kids. And stop making such movies!!",negative
1,Director Disaster.. No Brain,"Unnecessarily Hyped movie Just Distaster. No story.. No proper linking to action shown... Failure of Director.. no brainer ...

In Equalizer.. taking normal middle age guy they have shown tremendous action... even part 3rd made good.. If you are ciniphile u should watch how to avoid becoming as Fail director.. In this case director is just lucky he is in Bollywood..

Bobby deol entry is after 2nd half and he goes before movie ending.. and worst part .makers are going to make its 2nd part too.. not sure how can ranvir's die hard can even digest this too.. movies are reflection of society and if this is true then we have gone too down ..movies like animal are shame to society.please don't waste your precious time over this.,negative
1,Garbage,Finally watched this on Netflix and had zero expectations. It didn't even match that. Felt like a movie made by a child by joining a too many different small clips with too many different ideas into one film.It's not the misogyny or the over the top action scenes or how they depicted the main character that bothered me the most. It's the cavalier attitude to the storyline. Was it about father son issues or some thriller where a cousin tried to kill his uncle to get the business or was it about the phycological issues he had. There is no seriousness to really explore any area. It seems like they got an idea to make a movie on father son issues but also wanted to add action and other stuffs and in the end became a garbage.PS what was the point of Tripti dimri or Bobby deol character. They just felt ohh we need some more action let's add some other random storyline.,negative
1,Movie not even animals would want to watch,"If i let a wild monkey sit in front of a cinema screen and watch this impressively garbage movie it would go insane. If you want to watch a movie with a childish plot, unnecessary scenes, constant fillers, god awful screenplay, and well below average acting by the cast, this is the movie for you!Absolute waste of time. Meaningless and worthless movie, would rather watch paint dry for 3 hours instead. Many a times I have felt the urge to grab the gun out of Ranbir Kapoor's hands and shoot him with it, for the sake of self and everyone watching in the theater with me. Shoddy acting, half the audience was laughing at emotional scenes because they lack any sort of material that humans can sympathise with, and seeing the actions of the main character alone was enough for me to consider him the villain of this movie. NO thank you for producing, writing, filming, and releasing this pile of garbage.",negative
1,Disappointing and disrespectful,"A disgrace to the Indian censor board for passing this movie through. This movie encourages violence,violence and violence. Shocked to see how many people have actually liked this,which is a scary figure for the Indian future and generations..This movie should be banned and erased.I am wondering what impact this will have on our youth. The script writer and the director should have proper psychiatric assessment as to what motive that entails for such movie.I am numb with my emotions as how can well established Bollywood stars like bobby deol,ranvir Kapoor accept such roles and scripts.I would suggest to avoid watching this and I am discouraging everyone for swaying their interests from this Bollywood disaster.Just to end the reference of 18+ scenes and the language omits this for a family watch or even good value friend watch..
Pathetic movie of the millennium.",negative
1,Character less hero movie,"There is no character, no true for father, no loyalty with wife, shame less character. Total insane, point less worst movie.Director didn't justify the role of father and son and he cheated with audience, I bet 50% percent of audience going watch to see lord Bobby. But director made us fool, if you want to see bobby just see trailer I mean you can see more Bobby in the trailer than in the movie. So it's a worst movie after interval.My recommendation to teens. If you want to see movie on love and respect for father. It's a Anil Kapoor movie - Virasat 1997. Please watch of real Indian cinema.",negative
1,Indian cinema is being hit by bullets and suffocated by smoke,"The movie had strong soul (father and sone relationship) but it was killed brutally with all the bullets flying around and suffocated with cigarette smoke. There is a long action sequence in the hotel .... three different scenarios with different background music. It was just to prove that we are inspired by the Korean movies .... nothing else. Anybody can kill anybody, fire bullets at their will and carry guns like a showpiece. Ranbir's brilliance is lost in the inconsistent emotions and scene transitions. Rashmika's cry out was unheard due to her dialogue delivery, I could not understand it. She was just following and kissing her 'alpha' male. Anil Kapoor's father ..... who was he .... Was he harsh, tough, smart, mellow, silent observer or just reacting to his son's actions. It seems like the movie was directed by two different persons.... One directing the first half and other following the second half. I came out of theatre and trust me there wasn't any moment which I carried with myself. There is no logic in the director's land. All the rules are dictated by hero. But youngsters are going to learn many things from this movie...... smoke as much cigarettes as you want, its classy aur kuch bhi nahi hoga. Be an 'alpha male' to your girlfriends. No matter how you treat your girlfriend, she is going to kiss you back. Special request to the director .... ""take as many liberties you want but don't make movie out of liberties"". There are some guys who can think in the audience. I regret that I watched the movie and added into the hundreds of crores movie is making cause this the only which has been talked about.",negative

The movie's extremely violent scenes are not my problem. The nonsense and disgusting dialogues and never ending stretched tiresome screenplay are my problems. There are so many unnecessary dialogues and scenes which could have been easily edited are included just to attract local indian Andrew tates. The country where actors and movies are embraced as a crux of life and then in every 20 minutes a girl is harrased or ra#ped,you are using such dialogues and glorifying such character mean you are mentally unstable.

1,Iam a Telugu person & Iam ASHAMED of this Telugu director. DISGUSTING!!!,"Just a few years ago we used to make typical Mass Masala movies with Hero being a badass & Heroine being the cutest with TONS of comedy & songs & entertainment. It was a blast for audience. It made us fall in love with our Tollywood. The audience would enjoy & witness pure awesomeness on screen. But now people dont want those movies anymore. They want something ""new & content oriented & great"". And because of that, now we get movies like ANIMAL. Its borderline INSULTING to see such PATHETIC FILMS in Tollywood. Its a DRASTIC change in the film making of Tollywood. Iam shocked.This movie is not a Telugu movie, its a Hindi movie. But its made by a Telugu director who made a similar type of movie called Arjun Reddy in Tollywood, which had a good story but was STILL bad in MANY WAYS. Here in this film, theres a mediocre story with barely any storytelling in sight. It has nothing to offer other than a PATHETIC, CHARACTERLESS, DEGENERATE HERO. If this HORRIBLE director continues making movies like this then hes going to ruin Tollywood. I cant believe that such a PATHETIC Director can come from Tollywood of all places. Tollywood makes movies that are Good to Average to Absolutely Beautiful movies. This is not the representation of Tollywood or its directors. I cant even believe it. This Sandeep Reddy Vanga (Director) needs to be KICKED OUT of Tollywood. Thats it.In this film, the Hero is constantly doing Vulgar scenes & kissing & sleeping with the Heroine & then later he cheats on the Heroine with another Woman with more sex scenes & kissing. He constantly shows his dominance over women way too many times & points to his DICK over & over & over like a degenerate. And theres no storytelling in sight & its pointlessly stretching with dirty scenes, making you feel like youre watching something degrading. Like a snuff film on screen.The Hero is constantly obsessed with Revenge when he DIDNT EVEN LOSE ANYTHING! His father was shot in the beginning but he went through surgery & is still alive & doing well but for some reason the Hero STILL WANTS REVENGE!! KILLING HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. ITS PATHETIC. It LITERALLY makes no sense. And in the end, the Hero SLASHES two people with a blade over & over & over with blood ALL OVER THE ROOM. That scene has ZERO style of Film making or Cinematography & its looking like a degenerate scene with no meaning. Its completely degrading.The acting is the only saving grace. The main lead Ranbir Kapoor does great acting & the father Anil Kapoor too with a great chemistry in the Climax. But their story is not focused here at all. Instead we get to see the main leads obsession with getting Revenge & HORRIBLE DEGENERATE behavior in the middle.These kinds of films are BAD for our society. We're Indians, we're not foreigners who let these kinds of degenerate, gore porn filled, evil, R-Rated vulgar scenes, characterless protagonist movies release with no care in the world. The youth will be spoilt & will be encouraged to do those horrible things like the hero does in this movie. These kinds of films need to be BANNED in India with a WARNING for new directors who think they're making ""Masterpieces"" or ""Being Creative"" by making DISGUSTING MOVIES like this.A 0/10 from me, even though there were some good parts & the acting was good. I cant even imagine sitting & watching this movie again. HORRIBLE!!!",negative
1,A Toxic Symphony of Violence,"The negativity in the movie isn't problematic the most problematic thing is these kind of negativity (adultery,violence, disrespecting women, violence of law and order etc) being glorified, being portrayed by the protagonist. Simple question: Would you prefer a husband who is a psychopath and has an extramarital affair and later on becomes a father like this? If youth is comfortable with this movie then it shows their loose mentality and it tends to degraded and worse face of coming generations. But i think the best movie of the year goes to 12th Fail❤ It just showcases the reality. Movies like animal are far from reality and idk ppl get wrong ideas and they start implementing it.",negative
2,An Imagination Limited to the Director's Inability to think straight,This doesn't even deserve a review let alone elaborating it. But I've to since I'm compelled by the minimum character rule in this textbox.Toxic.. Negative.. Antisocial.. Disturbing.. Misguiding.. Unbearable..You ask here whether it contains spoilers?! Well... the whole movie (if I may call it as one!) is filled with things that will spoil every viewers' psyche whilst he/she tries to imagine what's happening.And eventually mis leading them to believe that they watched a movie whereas it's just a figment of the Director's (again If I may call him so!) ugly imagination and ignorant self belief of narrating this piece of work as a story to audience.This cannot get any lower than this in terms of the maker's sheer audacity and arrogance.I shouldn't have watched it in the first place knowing it's premise.

1,1st half Thrilling - 2nd Half Utter Disappointment,"It's because of disappointing movies like this, I have started distancing myself from Bollywood and I ask the people I interact with to do the same. From a ""Die for my family"" theme, it instantly changed into a total disregard for sentiments of a specific religious group. It's now become a norm in Bollywood for your script to have Anti Pakistan or Anti Muslim content, for you to be get bumped up as an actor and as a production.

Anil Kapoor had showcased another Dil dhadakne do father's character..
Actors like Bobby Deol, Anil Kapoor, Shakti Kapoor remain under utilized. The entire focus was on Ranbir which failed to amuse public. Many of the people even walked off.People who are giving good rating to such a nuisance are not human...",negative
1,Please don't make the sequel,"If you're into erratic violence, blood splashing around and a psycho main character, then this is the film for you. What troubled me most was that the main character's portrayal seemed to try and give an rationalisation for his brutal aggression, as if 'the poor boy couldn't help it'. Which of course, he can and should as any reasonable adult person. I would have liked a worked out father-son reconciliation theme, but in this case, the father can only stare at his son and think ""what monster have I created?"" I recently saw a YouTube video about discrimination of Indians in South Korea, which upset me because I have grown to love India. But after watching Animal, I can understand why people, and women especially, should be scared of Indian men. Of course, it is only a fictional film, but the adultery, the laughing about violence, the ease of using violence, the total absence of forgiveness, gives a very grim picture of Indian men.What also worried me, but that is something that was also present in the non-violent film Kapoor & Sons, was the disrespect to servant workers. I suppose the caste system is still very real and if you're in the wrong caste, you will not even be surprised that people look down on you, or, as in Animal, slap a plate of food that you have just served against the wall. Or starting a sex scene in front of a servant as if she is just a piece of furniture.For me, this film made me cringe and wonder 'how much longer do I have to watch this?' But I watched Animal because Arijit Singh sings in it, so I had to wait for that. When Satraanga began, I nearly cried, as this beautiful song was combined with a dreadful scene of domestic violence. After that, I had definitely no more hope this film would end well in any way.",negative

Not only watching this movie was waste of time and everything, even writing a review about it is a waste of time.

3,Painful to watch,"An awfully stretched out movie. Storyline made no sense whatsoever & was all over the place.It was said to be a story about a 'Father-Son's broken relationship' but was barely anything there to build up to it.Corny and awfully poor dialogue worse than Brahmastra. Sex/Dirty jokes are funny to some level but not every other minute.Acting started out strong but went downhill.Editing and cinematography was average and at some point looked like a fan made or a parody movie.Although there were few good qualities -
1) Action was awesome.2) BGM & Music was fantastic.3) Climax (Bobby Deol's entry, From the final fight scene till the end was the only amusing part)
One star for each.Gore and Violence was unbelievable which I really liked as Bollywood films tend no to go too graphic.Could cut a few unnecessary scenes and build up the father-son relationship and more screen time and history behind Bobby Deol's character & it would have been an amazing movie.",negative
1,Lot of action & Good Music,"The movie sure has a lot of action scenes and some of them are good but other than that there is no story, no character development. Acting is just average Music was good, I feel like Ranbir chooses worse character than all the manchild and playboy he plays in movies most of the time.This movie contains extreme violence, adult content. Strictly no children. Can be reduced to 1 hour. Hotel action, underwear, zoya, bobby deol introduction make marriage movie boring. Detracts from the main plot. There is no police even once in the movie. I had expectations for this movie but it didn't live up to the expectations. This movie is a total waste of time.",negative

He is really a versatile actor. He did this with so intensity. Bobby Deol is in beast mode. Rashmika got a decent role. This is a masterpiece by SandeepReddyVanga and Ranbir Kapoor which will remain in everyone's heart for years and years... Remember the name Sandeep Reddy Vanga. All hail pride of our TFI . Special mention to my brother Harshavardhan Rameshwar knew him since ArjunReddy days.what a BGM man that interval fight goosebumps guaranteed with this film SRV will enter to next league of filmmakers in Indian cinema, HUGE EXPECTATIONS will be on Spirit now.

Only Ranbir could have matched the superamacy of Bahubali, style of Pushpa and larger than life character in KGF, all combined in this ANIMAL.Amazing screenplay, direction and choice of supporting characters and music. This was a treat to watch on this weekend snowy day.Only catch is that this movie may be too much with family and might not fly off with that group. Watching with friends and colleagues, this will give you that adrenaline rush on a boring day, but will still leave you full of mixed emotions.And there is a surprising element as well. This will not let the movie impression go away for some while for sure.",positive
4,In a world where there are no Cops,"Only if the director had established that he has set a movie where Cops and Media (except cnbc) doesn't exist, he would have justified his bizarre artistic license he rendered in creating this mess of a movie which tries hard to be at the league of Sin City and Kill Bill.Horribly edited with unnecessary scenes included and important links missed out, the movie flows so abruptly that even an amateur editor would laugh at this blunder of a work.Only the action choreographer and the director of photography are worth some applause as they did a great job.While, Ranbir. Kapoor and Bobby Deol gave their 100%, yet the director failed in carving a memorable character persona, primary reason being that the director just couldn't decide whether his protagonist is an out and out a pshyco or a normal guy with anger issues.So, the result is a mix of Michael Corleone and Sharukh Khan's character in Darr. Is Ranbir Kapoor an obsessed lover or an intelligent sane man who secures the legacy of his large-scale business family strategically, the director just doesn't know and he doesn't care and takes the story wherever he wants in a way that makes the audience uncomfortable to relate to the character let alone the situations where he kills hundreds of men in broad daylight with no alert to police and no propaganda by the media.The movie's hype is the larger than life getaway mood for the audience, but the lack of sensibility and bad editing couldn't save the movie and lands it as a forgettable blockbuster.",negative
1,GARBAGE,Absolute garbage. It's a sincere request to all moviegoers to not promote such movies. Indian cinema deserves better and has the ability to Create much better movies. This is not just misogynistic but also sends an outrightly wrong message about how several aspects are perceived in the Indian society. Does not deserve to play In the theatres for even 1 Rupee. Please do not applaud the acting and actors.

8,"Animal A Cinematic Plunge into Moral Shadows, Propelled by Kapoor's Unsettling Brilliance","Animal,"" the latest creation from director Sandeep Reddy Vanga, plunges audiences into a raw and unapologetic exploration of crime and redemption.This 3-hour and 30-minute cinematic journey is not for the faint of heart, boasting intense storytelling, unsettling violence, and a standout performance by Ranbir Kapoor.In the vein of Vanga's previous work in ""Kabir Singh,"" ""Animal"" fearlessly delves into the darker facets of human nature. The narrative is uncompromising, offering a brutal look at the consequences of choices, all set against a backdrop of morally ambiguous characters.Ranbir Kapoor, in a departure from his typical roles, embraces the challenge of portraying a truly unlikable character. Kapoor's brilliance lies in making you despise his character while simultaneously acknowledging the complexity and depth of his portrayal. It's a performance that's off-putting yet undeniably captivating, showcasing Kapoor's versatility as an actor.The film's soundtrack, hauntingly beautiful, adds an eerie layer to the story. It doesn't seek to comfort; instead, it amplifies the discomfort, enhancing the overall sense of unease that permeates the narrative. This bold musical choice pays off, leaving a lasting impression on the viewer.Cinematographer Amit Roy deserves commendation for capturing the raw essence of every moment. The violence, though off-putting for some, is portrayed with an unflinching gaze, adding authenticity to the narrative. Roy's work elevates the visual storytelling, making each frame a powerful and evocative piece of art.Now, addressing the elephant in the room - the unlikable protagonist and the unapologetic violence may not resonate with everyone. ""Animal"" challenges conventional notions of a likable lead, and Kapoor's character is intentionally crafted to be morally ambiguous. If you're looking for a conventional hero, you won't find one here.In conclusion, ""Animal"" is a cinematic plunge into the abyss, unapologetically brutal and anchored by a stellar yet unlikable performance from Ranbir Kapoor. While the violence may be a deterrent for some, and Kapoor's character a tough pill to swallow, for those willing to embrace the darkness, ""Animal"" offers a thought-provoking and unforgettable experience. It's not a film for everyone, but for those seeking cinematic boldness and depth, ""Animal"" delivers in spades.",positive
3,Animal is a boring saga,"Animal starring Ranbir Kapoor,Rashmika & Anil Kapoor is an awful attempt to create a movie like Oldboy(gory action scenes), every scene in the movie is like Godfather & Second half is like Kabir Singh and Arjun Reddy married version.The story is nicely paced in first half with gore action sequences and bloodshed with some sense of vision by the director but in the second half added some unnecessary scenes with half cooked sub plot. Bobby Deol is under used in the film
Cinematography is upto the mark casting is good but All
the way its the Ranbir Kapoor show and Anil Kapoor is nowhere in the movie. Rashmika character is strong but i felt under used. There are many loopholes and it makes this film a boring undercooked action saga in the end.BGM and songs are great but the film lacks in heart and soul and some script🙂",negative

1,Meaningless movie on unwanted violence,"Went to this movie with a great expectation as I like ranbir, movie was like without story or screenplay. Repeated boring violence like current south violence trend. Ranbir acting was really good along with lord bobby. One of the weekest point in the movie is casting Rashmika, actor with zero acting skill and expression. Bollywood should stop casting this type of actors. Music was good, screenplay was too weak no storyline at all. Ranbir one man show couldn't save this movie. Second half is too boring that you will come out of theatre. Ranbir please stop acting with this south directors and cast you will spoil your career, Awaiting badly for Dunki .",negative
10,Vanga Masterpiece. He never misses.,"Few films manage to leave an indelible mark as profoundly as Animal has done. Coming from Vanga, this film not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also serves as a testament to his unparalleled craft in making dark movies.Ranbir unlocks a new personality in this one w as an onscreen animal, known for his ability to dissolve into his characters, outdoes himself in this role. His portrayal of a complex and layered individual, is both haunting and deeply moving. RK's ability to convey a spectrum of emotions, from vulnerability to intensity, is a masterclass in acting. It's a performance that resonates long after the credits roll.The director's vision for ""Animal"" is executed with such finesse that each scene feels like a carefully crafted masterpiece. The narrative is gripping, blending elements of drama, emotion, and suspense in a manner that is both seamless and impactful. The director's unique storytelling style, combined with an eye for detail, elevates the film to a level that is rare in contemporary cinema.Moreover, the cinematography and the score are in perfect harmony with the film's tone, enhancing the emotional depth of the story. The visual aesthetics are stunning, capturing the essence of the film's theme and setting with remarkable clarity.In conclusion, this movie not only showcases the extraordinary talent of Ranbir Kapoor but also highlights the director's exceptional ability to create a cinematic experience that is both thought-provoking and emotionally stirring. It's a film that deserves all the accolades it receives and is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates the art of film-making at its finest.",positive
1,Uncomfortable 3 hours,"Sat through the movie as a women and walked away disgusted. The fact that this movie made it past any board is insane to me. Its 2023 misogynist behavior NEEDS to be reprimanded. Media shapes society whether we like it or not. The message this movie sends to society is that women are less than. Young men can't walk away from the theatres thinking that this is acceptable and inspirable behavior. Disappointing that writing female characters is still an issue in South Asian films. As a south Asian women its appalling that this is what our entertainment looks like. I had high expectations for this movie after hearing all the hype online its sad to know that this is what so many call a ""badass action movie"".",negative
6,The performances and the novelty in Ranbir and Bobby's characters make it worthwhile.,"In the first half, Vanga is in complete control. We get a quick tour of rural Punjab, which is just an excuse for a dozen burly 'puttars' to jump in: more boys, more toys, more risible jokes featuring the male nether regions. A kinetic sequence featuring a gigantic bazooka, and Ranbir Kapoor pumping hundreds of bullets into hundreds of bodies is the kind of gleeful comic-book action which is fun while it lasts. But then comes the endless second half in which everything is thrown at the kitchen sink in the hope something sticks. In the end, there's nothing to this pointless, vile tale: if I have to, I'd rather watch real animals.Arjun Reddy and Kabir Singh helmer Sandeep Reddy Vanga had said that he will teach Bollywood how to make a violent movie with Animal and trust me what he said, he delivered that without an ounce of doubt. On the whole, Animal is an adrenaline experience which will have polarising views but you can't deny its entertaining quotient, breathtaking performances and storytelling.Watch Animal for Ranbir Kapoor. He doesn't let you down in even one frame. If you are a hard-core action movie fan, Animal has enough and more to keep you hooked to the screen. The story is engaging and though, long, the performances and the novelty in Ranbir and Bobby's characters make it worthwhile.",negative
1,Waste of money and time,"Worst movie ever seen. No story no proper dialogue just fake action. Beating eachother whole movie and absurd no sense making scenes. Don't know wth i watched. Never recommend and once again Bollywood is just crap. They showed how absurd they are. Ladies dont go at all just crappy intimate secens to attract audience. Whole movie is just papa papa papa nothing else. Waste of time. Stretched movie to 3.5 hours so many waste scenes could hv been cut. But just added to waste viewers time. Huge flop with immature action scenes, cheating, no proper storyline no proper scenes no script just vulgar language.",negative
1,What an apt name!,"The hero, villan, hero's cousins and villans brothers are all portrayed as animals. I would say even the director is an animal to have envisaged such a movie. Alas, sadly animals live by certain rules and are more disciplined than the crew who made this.Who in the name of God would glorify a hero taking a gun to the school?In the name of alpha male the director is just brainwashing young minds.Strictly speaking the censor board should have banned the movie.If this is the future of movie making, i dread to see a future like this in which my children and their children would live.In one word...be ready to watch it at the expense of your precious time and then to see a psychotherapist. You'll need it.",negative
1,Does Ranbir want his daughter to watch this?,"Ranbir is a superstar, a father and a celebrity belonging to legendary Kapoor family. What Sandeep Reddy has done to him is bad for his image. Ranbir will look back at this crap years from now and regret this. Kind of vulgarity, violence, misogyny on display here that takes one back to medieval times. Movie's plot is weak and it gets boring. Is there any police in the entire world for the worst type of violence that a person can commit without any repercussions?The movie drags at snail pace at 3 hours and 25 minutes specially second half is miserably slow. Editing is terrible. Only plus is good background music but that's not enough to salvage poor concept and editing. Although one can remorse that excellent music is such a waste on such psychotic direction. The movie should have been named ""Psychopath"" rather than animal.Bobby Deol has a short role. He is like a wannabe hero forcibly acting as a villain. Anil Kapoor is the best actor overall.. however in a nutshell he's basically a failed father.Overall it's disturbing to see men raving about this violent and misogynistic junk. Raises questions on mental health of many and to the director... Mr Sandeep, please calm down next time.. take chill pill and don't go psychotic with the idiotic sounding 'animal park'.",negative
1,Animal: A Cinematic Misstep in Portraying Toxic Masculinity,"""Animal"" unfolds as a misguided cinematic endeavor, raising red flags for its portrayal of a central character steeped in possessiveness. The narrative traces back to the protagonist's school days, depicting him as the self-appointed heir to the family throne after an evidently neglectful father. This skewed sense of responsibility leads him to make decisions for others, showcasing a troubling dynamic.The film takes a regrettable turn by treating the central character's wife as an object and projecting a palpable disdain towards women. Such regressive depictions can confuse Gen Z viewers, who often prioritize progressive values. The violence depicted in the movie, coupled with the absence of law enforcement despite countless murders, adds a layer of inconsistency that undermines the narrative's credibility.A glaring departure from reality occurs when the protagonist engages in a prolonged, physically demanding fight post-heart surgery, straining the bounds of believability. However, amidst these narrative missteps, the film does salvage some merit through commendable performances. Ranbir Kapoor's commitment to the director's vision shines through, offering a silver lining in an otherwise turbulent storyline.The background music proves to be a standout element, complementing the intense scenes effectively. Unfortunately, the placement of songs during crucial junctures, such as the interval block fight and encounters with the main villain, fails to capture and sustain audience interest. These moments, rather than enhancing the cinematic experience, contribute to a disjointed narrative.In conclusion, while ""Animal"" boasts strong performances and noteworthy musical compositions, these aspects are overshadowed by a problematic storyline. The film's portrayal of possessiveness, mistreatment of women, and an unrealistic portrayal of physical resilience post-surgery undermine its potential. ""Animal"" ultimately falls short of delivering a compelling cinematic experience and, on the whole, is not worth the investment of time and attention.",negative
5,Animalistic,"Animalistic as it sounds. The movie was more animal than the animal itself. So rude, disrespectful towards women, promoting incest behavior: first of all Reshmika, on the set Gitanjali called her beast as brother and then out of nowhere somewhere in the sky they are having intercourse, are you bonkers af? In a functional goddamn helicopter with them as pilots. Yo you better be bugging. And the female characters were so manipulative just like rashmika, I hated that performance. According to the animal theory from the movie, women are born to reproduce and have a sound decision to make out with alpha man of the tribe. Alpha man has to be one and the rest are literally sissies. Like where do you get these toxic masculine patriarchal thoughts from? The only look I liked of the movie was sardars as side characters, they had good personality for some reasons and that too had a bitter truth trait sticked to their characters as well. Kabir Singh's high version movie, I mean high. High. Father-son relations were portrayed as toxic, wife-husband and so was sibling relations too. And the attitude? Don't get me to it, bro that was above the pyramid that it hit to the height of Burj Khalifa that the attitude the hero had. Sad to miss Bobby and the national crush of India, but by the time my patient was outrun.",negative
4,Animal not worth the Roar,"Few things works in this movie and many doesnt.Animal is a good mix of emotions but explained badly.

This is a simle story of dad and son, which is devastated by forcefully introducing those vulgar action scenes . I went to watch the late night show of this movie after all the hype it created. But sorry to say that you will feel like vomiting after watching the movie. One person is cutting another with an axe and another and other.... and this goes on in the entire movie.

5,Extreme violent psycho director,"First of all
There wasn't a story over all
Action action and action
As we all informed that this film is chemistry between father and son
There wasn't such a thing in the movie
In his childhood he took the gun and went to the school
What a message to the society that if some ragging happens take gun and go to school
Then on his comeback vijay argued with brother in law without specific reason
Turned a girl calling her brother into wife
Then had a intimate scene in air
This director so imaginative
He can imagine any thing
Then suddenly balbir singh got attacked and shot by two bullets but he was safe
Why his brother in law was against balbir still a mystery
He took guns and goons in a meeting killing his own brother in law
And later on taking 300 people in hotel with gun machine
His all goons are safe and he was on verge of death
Every thing finished with him he was in coma come out of it with all damage parts but he was ok
Specially his physical abilities to have SE** was finished
(Later director forget this point and he had Se* with zoya)
Suddenly bobby deol appears only to die
Bobby deol cant speak and ranbir cant talk like 5Th standard student making story
Why bobby deol grand father kicked from company still mystery and then turned into muslim family
Sikh turned into muslim family what a joke what a joke
This is insult to sikh brothers
Sikh always proud of there religion and this funny director insulted them
Then suddenly vijay walk naked in his home front of his father and mother what a shameful sceneI recommend to ban this kind of movie
These are disasters to society.",negative
1,Ridiculous,1 star only for acting of Ranbir. Bobby in a very very short appearance leaves a mark. No story. Nonsense plot. Mindless action. Please don't make such movies. Distribute this money for the welfare of the poor. Not sure the intention in showcasing good actors to such useless story. Not sure why they opt to act in such films.Then the female lead has done a good job. However had a confusing persona created for her and just a fit in the middle. When he goes away for a while she is not bothered to see where he is. And when he is back then all ridiculous questions. Not sure the intent.Actually should have expected this after Kabir singh. Regret went to see.,negative

1,"""Toxic Tropes: The Regressive World of 'Animal' and the Repetitive Style of Sandeep Reddy Vanga""","""Animal"" plunges into the abyss of third-class cinema, cementing director Sandeep Reddy Vanga's penchant for toxic masculinity. The storyline, a disconnected fantasy, shockingly justifies heinous acts, portraying the absurd notion that massacring people and committing international murder holds some twisted justification. Vanga's trademark cliche-ridden narrative rears its head again, delivering a predictable and uninspired tale that adds nothing substantial to his repertoire.The film's central theme revolves around toxic masculinity, exploring the psyche of a psychopathic male, but does so with a shocking lack of depth or meaningful commentary. It appears more as a feeble attempt at shock value than a genuine exploration of complex human emotions.Sandeep Reddy Vanga's consistent delivery of subpar and regressive narratives raises concerns about his creative direction. ""Animal"" feels like a sorry excuse for cinema, promoting outdated stereotypes without any redeeming qualities. The audience, if they dare to watch, should prepare to leave all expectations of a coherent plot or meaningful character development at the door, as this film adds little value to the world of cinema and unfortunately reinforces Sandeep Reddy Vanga's reputation for delivering cinematic disappointments.",negative
1,Where is censor bourd ?,"I am surprise how censor bourd allowed it for indian society. Just to write it's for 18+ . Can anyone watch it with hits family. N#ked scene, slang word, abused women. This type of movie subconsciously change society. We are indian not western.Movies sometimes have words and scenes that might not be good for everyone, especially in a country like India where people follow certain cultural values. To decide if a movie is okay for different age groups, there's something called a censor board. In India, it's called the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). They check movies for things like bad language, violence, and sexual content.Now, if a movie has a lot of slang words and sexual scenes, some people might say it's not good for Indian culture. But how does a movie like that get approved by the censor board?The censor board has rules, and the movie has to follow them. These rules are different in every country because every place has its own way of thinking about what's okay and what's not. In India, the censor board looks at things like language, nudity, violence, and sexual content.But here's the thing: it's not just up to the censor board. People in society also have opinions. Some might say that a movie with too much slang and sex scenes goes against our traditional values. Others might argue that it's all part of telling a story realistically.One way to make things easier for everyone is by putting labels on movies. These labels tell you if a movie is okay for kids or if it's more for grown-ups. They might also warn about specific content, like strong language or adult scenes. This helps families decide what movies are right for them.However, filmmakers also play a big role. They need to be careful about how they tell their stories. They can make powerful movies without using too much bad language or showing too many adult scenes. This way, more people can enjoy their movies without feeling uncomfortable.It's important for everyone-filmmakers, the censor board, and the audience-to talk and understand each other. This helps in making rules that make sense for everyone. In a diverse country like India, where people have different beliefs, having these conversations is crucial.So, when it comes to movies with slang language and sexual scenes, it's a balancing act. The censor board and movie labels help guide us, but it's also up to filmmakers to tell stories in a way that respects our culture. As people keep talking and understanding each other, we can make sure that movies reflect our values while still being interesting and enjoyable for everyone.",negative

My god what a disappointing garbage I witnessed...
I literally felt guilty next 5 hours after watching this stupid movie.I actually went to watch Hindi movie in theatre after many years only to be this disappointed.When will Indian audience grow their movie standards?Indian audiences have always loved a movie where there are no logics, movies like this crap will always be made as long as audiences do not raise the standard.It's the audience's fault these kind of movies are always fed to meet the demand of garbage.",negative

2,If Andrew Tate Made a Bollywood Movie,"I swear, Sandeep Reddy Vanga hates women. I really didn't think his movies could get any more misogynistic than Arjun Reddy or Kabir Singh but, hats off to the ""creator"", he's managed to surpass himself by creating the vilest, most toxic protagonist/""hero"" I have ever seen on the big screen.Ranbir Kapoor's Ranvijay Singh Balbir has absolutely zero redeeming qualities. Now, usually there is nothing wrong with that as we have seen our fair share of psychos in films that we have appreciated but Vanga makes abundantly clear that not only are we meant to understand his protagonist's intentions, we are actually supposed to root for him. We are supposed to laugh and hoot as he denegrades women every chance he gets and then nod accordingly when he attempts to justify why he is behaving the way he is. To say I was squirming watching this with my wife would be the biggest understatement of the decade.I was hoping the promised over-the-top action set pieces and the acting from seasoned performers like Anil Kapoor, Suresh Oberoi, Prem Chopra and Bobby Deol would make some of the vileness worthwhile but it didn't come anywhere close.There are a couple of enjoyable and applaudable moments in the film like a young and rambunctious Ranbir defends his sister against bullies at college, Ranbir Kapoor's quarrelling with his brother-in-law at his father's birthday party or Ranbir Kapoor gathering his troops in Punjab but these fleeting moments don't make up for sitting through over 3 and a half hours of something that comes across as an extended advertisement of masculinity made by the Tate brothers.If this film is lauded and becomes a blockbuster amongst Indians, I can only sympathise with the stature in which women are perceived by Indian males.",negative
2,A pointless storyline filled with mindless violence,How does one review a film like Animal?Does one focus on the incessant use of violence to give shock value? Or the disgusting objectification of women to a point where their only purpose in the world appears to be to serve men?

Despite its 3:30-hour runtime, the film captivates without a moment of tedium.First Half: The movie swiftly establishes the father-son dynamic, unraveling the layers that transformed Ranbir into a formidable force. The narrative's depth shines through engaging dialogues, becoming the highlight of the film. The Interval block stands out as one of the most compelling sequences I've ever witnessed.Second Half: While the pace momentarily decelerates to portray the repercussions of bloodshed on the protagonist and his family, the film never loses momentum. Every scene propels the narrative forward, although some may initially seem misplaced, ultimately serving as essential building blocks for the impending twist.Musical Integration: Seamlessly woven into the storyline, the songs seamlessly complement the narrative, ensuring they don't disrupt the movie's flow. Ranbir's portrayal reaches a career zenith, with no scene feeling like mere filler.Noteworthy Element: The main character's vulnerability sets this film apart, defying the trope of invincibility. The post-credit scene marks the movie's second peak, a crucial element not to be missed.Final Verdict: For enthusiasts of action, gore, and complex characters, this film is a must-watch. It demands both your time and monetary investment, delivering a cinematic experience that transcends conventional boundaries.",positive

However, from my perspective it wasn't a movie rather it was a disaster.

On a positive note, the film made me appreciate my family's time and reminds me to make sure to read the synopsis of the film first before watching it with family.

The film unfolds like a raging case of dysentery, leaving you feeling queasy and desperately searching for the nearest exit!Just like dysentery, this Bollywood flick hits you with an onslaught of twists and turns, but instead of stomach cramps, it's melodramatic plotlines and over-the-top song and dance sequences that leave you feeling a bit woozy.Sure, both dysentery and this Bollywood extravaganza can be intense experiences, but while dysentery has you rushing to the bathroom, this movie has you reaching for the popcorn bucket in hopes of finding some relief from its relentless assault on your senses.In the end, you might emerge from the theater feeling a bit drained and exhausted, much like recovering from a bout of dysentery. But hey, at least you can say you survived the Bollywood equivalent of a gastrointestinal adventure!",negative
10,Animal OMG,"What a Movie... The first half is so good... yes it is a little lengthy, but want an awesome movie... Ranbir Kapoor is actually the best actor no doubt, the direction bhai sandeep reddy vanga is now one of my best director want to see what this has to deliver more.There is not much action but one do not have to show the Animal inside you.The father son is nice.. do not miss the interval. The actress is not good at all they would have casted someone better.Bobby deol get very less screen time, but its amazing what he do with it...i will watch it again 100/10 is what i will give..............",positive
3,Good action but unacceptable story and boring boring,Directors are taking the indian citizens as granted. Movie shows a load of bad dialogues and lot of insults to women and society. I could not figure out if the movie was shot in India or in Mexico.Movie is about a son who lives his father no matter how much his father hates him. I still am trying my best to figure out what this movie wish to inspire the viewers? I cant understand what this movie was made of. Yes it had some good acting by Lord Bobby and Ranbir but no where this movie is acceptable where all are insulting each other and Ranbir to get the truth of his enemy slept with another girl and just moved on with his wife like nothing happened.No cops or nothing to investigate so many murders. This movie have nothing new to be honest and don't know why a few are saying its the benchmark of Indian movie where according to me the benchmark were Lagaan and Swadesh.This movie only focused on Ranbir Kapoor but very few scenes of Lord Bobby and others as if they were completely non existent.,negative
2,Three hours of torture not a movie.,"This is not a movie but 3 hours of torture. Undoubtedly Ranbir's acting was good but the movie doesn't have a script, and full of illogical sequences and redundant action sequences. Nothing is worth watching. You will go berserk by the intermission and will be left with a heavy head.Totally misogynistic. The female characters don't have any substance and they are just puppet of the so called protagonist of the story. This movie also promotes vandalism, indiscipline and hypocrisy at many levels.They just created hype to earn more in the first week. So many scenes look exactly as Kabir SinghIt isn't worth your hard earned money. Better avoid it.",negative
1,Absolute Cringe !!,"While movies from one part of India have been ruling the industry and giving blockbuster one after the other like Kanatara and KGFBullywood is still using using the same old plot of violence and movies glorifying gangsters blood shed vilians potrayal as Hero#Animal really is 3 hrs filled with bloodshed and rage with vulgar dialogues abusive with skin show
and bit of dailog here and there which hardly make any sense or take the movie forwardThere is Huge void in terms stitching the story together and audience will feel lost after sometimeDon't Waste Time Better watch OTT series and save money.",negative
2,Family Drama Derailed.,"Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice ( actually fifth time ) shame on me.Bollywood has tried to do different (with a Director-Writer actually coming from Tollywood) which again hyped by trailer released to create a troubled father-son relationship but some how falls flat particular in the second half which feels like endless.Sandeep Reddy Vanga has some serious problems with women who has once again (Arjun Reddy and Kabir Singh for the past reference) has presented a 3 hours and 21 minutes long movie comprised of bloodshed, testosterone and blatant misogyny to glorify the alpha Male-esque tale.Though trailer and songs have portrayed a movie filled with violence but some how father-son relationship shown in trailer is lost and the protagonist has become saviour of the family with whom we have sympathise as he is a love less child who takes refuge in bestiality as he didn't get attention of his rich and always busy PAPA whereas affection showered by MOTHER and SISTER means nothing.Acting is good, music is also very good but for 201 odd minutes it's a endless loop.",negative
1,It should not approve to be released in theatre or on ott.,Such a disgusting and shameless movie.It portraying women like a toy.Father- Son theme is baseless. Screenplay laggs at most the time and some of the conversation on undergarments and sex is such that you will fill bad that this has been the quality of movies now a days are making without keeping in mind the families although all the things are happening in the family in movie. Wtf SRV made he should have to be stopped making movies like this.I don't know how censor has approved this kind of movie which will really mislead our youth.Waste of time and waste of money.Big disappointment.👎👎👎👎,negative
1,Mood spoiler..,"This movie is a mood spoiler and unnecessary action.. Except for two to three dialogues (which is already available in trailer) , rest movie is disaster..
I will not recommend.. After watching it felt like my precious 4 hours got wasted. The only thing i learnt from this is not to watch such movie in my lifetime. 3+ hour movie with no proper flow and storyline. Just wanted to add action and drama where it is not required. Story starts with a father and son relationship which got dragged into something else only. Ranbir kapoor's acting is good no doubt in that just expecting him to choose a better script.",negative
3,How come this is trending,"No logic , extreme toxic behaviour of hero portrayed with swag and music to cover it up. Rashmika acts as if a s*x addict who tolerates anything after her outburst and husband's criminal instincts. The 250 people who had come to fight the hero may be in a volvo bus or vande bharat train are killed and dumped there where he has put a cheat code like GTA.Copying KGF and Vikram from south indian and bolywood anyways doesn't need a logic works fornthis movie with superb online advertising. If you promote such movie they will deliver this masterpiece for 3 hours to waste our time and money and question our sense of understanding new age cinema.",negative
1,Dont watch !! Horrible ! Worst movie that could be made!,"This is definitely the worst movie that could ever be made. Commendable skills of the director and story writer to make it more and more boring for more than 3 hours with bakwaas unrelated plots !! This is commendable skillset of a different calibre.Worst punishment is to lose sleep and go for a late night show.Its just a massacre after massace no plots. Cheap KGF copy with no story and bakwaas details.Please book a psychiatrist before booking tickets for this movie and thank me later.Acting, direction, story and everything is at unimaginable lows.You could watch people repenting their decisions of coming to this movie and sleeping in theaters. I still have a doubt on how this pathetic of a movie can get such high ratings. This movie is worth rating in negative scale.PS: I signed up to imdb and wrote this review to pass time while trying to not watch this movie.",negative
5,"Animal - I was expecting a toxic action movie, but didn't expect this level of gore, violence, bloodshed, women disrespect, male chauvinism and raw, dirty dialogues.","Animal - I was expecting a toxic action movie, but didn't expect this level of gore, violence, bloodshed, women disrespect, male chauvinism and raw, dirty dialogues.This movie is a bad influence with scenes like kids taking guns to school and men complimenting women on the pelvic size and mocking their periods. ""Har shadi me darr hona chahiye"", ""first kiss hua, first slap nahi hua""...what kind of regressive dialogues are these?Ranbir has acted pretty well but this is the most disgusting character he has ever played. He repels!! Rashmika is bad, no expressions and bad dialogue delivery. Bobby has no screentime. Anil Kapoor seemed weak in this character. 3.5 hours length added to headache.What should I watch now for some cinematic detox?",negative
1,A sickening display of misogyny and alpha male nonsense,"This film severely disappoints by perpetuating harmful stereotypes, reducing women to mere objects catering to male desires. Its blatant disregard for a compelling plot or meaningful story renders it a regrettable watch. I find it challenging to respect the team responsible for this production, as it not only succumbs to the deplorable concept of misogyny but also perpetuates an outdated and toxic alpha male narrative. The film's lack of substance and its exploitation of gender dynamics overshadow any redeeming qualities it might have had, leaving a lasting impression of disappointment and frustration.",negative
1,Worst movie ever,"Despite a great line of actors involved, this movie fails to deliver. Such movies should be banned as they not only promote the wrong behavior (because of course many people may feel if Ranbir Kapoor is doing this it's probably cool and then why can't I?) but also spoil all the progress we've made as a country in uplifting women. Agreed that there are such bad characters in the society but promoting that by making a 10x worse version of it in a movie with famous celebrities is never a good idea. The movie just feels pointless without any good message or experience to take away from. Throughout its length, the only thought was why did I pay for this and is there any point in continuing to watch this craziness!",negative
1,Worst,"Basically Kabhie Khushi kabhi gaam on Drugs.Animal: A Gruesome Spectacle Devoid of Substance
Ranbir Kapoor's latest film, Animal, has roared into theaters, promising a thrilling and action-packed ride. Unfortunately, the film delivers little more than gratuitous violence, misogynistic themes, and an unoriginal storyline. Animal is a disappointment on almost every level, leaving viewers feeling numb and disillusioned rather than
entertained.Animal: A Gruesome Spectacle Devoid of Substance
Ranbir Kapoor's latest film, Animal, has roared into theaters, promising a thrilling and action-packed ride. Unfortunately, the film delivers little more than gratuitous violence, misogynistic themes, and an unoriginal storyline. Animal is a disappointment on almost every level, leaving viewers feeling numb and disillusioned rather than entertained.An Unforgivable Level of Violence:The film's most glaring flaw is its excessive and unnecessary violence. From brutal beatings to gruesome murders, Animal revels in bloodshed, leaving viewers feeling desensitized and disgusted. The violence feels gratuitous and exploitative, adding nothing to the story and serving only to shock and titillate.Misogyny Masquerading as Entertainment:Animal paints a deeply disturbing portrait of women, portraying them as objects to be possessed and controlled. The film's female characters are devoid of depth or agency, existing solely to serve the male protagonist's desires. This blatant misogyny is deeply offensive and undermines any attempt to enjoy the film.A Story That Lacks Originality:The film's plot follows a tired and predictable formula, offering nothing new or surprising to viewers. The characters are predictable archetypes, and the story unfolds in a way that feels derivative and uninspired. Animal feels like a reheated version of countless other gangster films, offering no reason to invest in its characters or their journey.A Waste of Talent:Ranbir Kapoor delivers a forgettable performance as the film's lead protagonist. He is unable to imbue his character with any depth or charisma, leaving the audience feeling indifferent to his fate. The supporting cast is equally disappointing, with none of the actors able to rise above the film's weak material.A missed opportunity:Animal had the potential to be a compelling and thought-provoking film. Unfortunately, the filmmakers opted for a cheap and sensational approach, sacrificing substance for shock value. The result is a film that is both morally repugnant and intellectually bankrupt.Here are some of the specific criticisms of the film:Gratuitous and unnecessary violence.Deeply offensive and misogynistic themes.Unoriginal plot and predictable characters.Forgettable performances from the cast.A complete lack of substance or meaning.Overall, Animal is a deeply disappointing film that squanders its potential. It is a gruesome spectacle that is devoid of any real entertainment value or artistic merit. If you are looking for a film that will challenge you and leave you thinking, I urge you to avoid Animal altogether.Rating: 1 out of 5 stars.",negative
1,A Cinematic Catastrophe,"This movie felt like a disjointed mess with a plot that went nowhere. The characters were one-dimensional, and the dialogue was painfully cliche. The cinematography was lackluster, leaving the entire viewing experience underwhelming. It seemed like the filmmakers prioritized flashy visuals over substance, resulting in a shallow and unengaging narrative. The soundtrack was a jarring mix of random tunes that did nothing to enhance the already lackluster atmosphere. Even the supposed emotional moments were so contrived that they failed to evoke any genuine feelings. In the end, it's a movie I wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy. Overall, watching this movie felt like a colossal waste of time.",negative
6,So Long but felt Short,"When I say movie was long but felt short - it's both a praise and it's short coming.Praise because it never really is boring - lots of action and decent story, especially in the first part keeps the audience engaged. Part of brother in law is very interesting (which is an old plot from great movies of past).Short coming because there is not enough meat there, the movie is lacking any depth. Our antagonist is not fleshed out at all, there is nothing to his character, he should have been given at least 15 more minutes to develop.Back story about the grandfather or the father of the main character could have been used to add layers to the story.All in all an ok movie, nothing special.",negative
4,Animal - Roar of disappointment,"Animal, the hyped-up spectacle promising a raw, Ranbir Kapoor-led descent into darkness, sadly stumbles into a pit of overindulgence and narrative inconsistencies. While the film boasts chart-topping soundtracks and audacious action sequences, it fails to deliver on its central promise: a compelling exploration of a flawed hero grappling with his inner beast. Instead, it devolves into a cacophony of excessive violence, questionable morals, and a protagonist devoid of the typical hero's redeeming qualities. Though the performances of Ranbir Kapoor, Bobby Deol, Rashmika and India's new crush, Tripti Dimri were excellent and the action scenes without relying heavily on VFX. The protagonist's respect for women could have been a crucial element in making them a more compelling and heroic figure.Also, the protagonist's actions often feel impulsive and illogical, making it difficult to understand his motivations as he is not portrayed having any mental illness, which really makes it one-time watch despite its worldwide collection!!",negative
3,For true filmy,"Talking about the review of Animal that the acting ,expression & attitude of every single actor has excellent but when talking about story, screenplay, editing & direction of this movie is totally disappointing the editing was worst it is simply 2hr 20 min movie if the editor of this movie has good in editing The Screenplay was below average the timing of song is not suit the situation & sometime bgm is save the screenplay
And story is different but the execution & direction is very poor for the demanding situation
Overall the movie is below average
Watch movie if you are die hard fan of Ranbir Kapoor 😍😍😍..",negative
1,"Waste of time. MOVIE IS SHAME ON INDIAN UPBRING, CULTURE and RELIGIONS","Guys, do not waste your time and money on such a piece of waste. None of the religions, whether Punjabi or Marathi, promotes violence. What is this movie trying to portray? Disrespect towards elders, murders, extramarital affairs under the guise of fatherly love. Seriously? These are pan-India movies, and such films destroy the reputation of the country and its residents abroad. Is the Indian police and army a joke? Open firings by a kid in public, 100 murders without any legal actions - is Indian law a joke? I don't know what the ideal message was, but it was definitely a story of the worst parenting and a criminal psycho kid. Seriously disappointed by Ranbir. He's such a brilliant actor, but what a terrible script.",negative
1,wasted opportunity,"It was the most non-sensical movie ever made. Playing to the gallery, has nothing good going there. Even Tripti Dimri looks wasted (it takes a lot to make her eye sore and shallow, director has succeeded in doing that).The trailer was built so well, I was really going for it. Acting wise Anil Kapoor takes the cake, ranbir is awesome thats all about it.The movie script was for sure written in upper case, its tonal loud. There's no cops here, its very convenient story (everything happens according to the whims of ranbir kapoor).The movie easily could have been an hour less (or less than 120 minutes) it would have been supremely tight actioner.Yes this movie will make money, as if that's the only thing that matters.Saw Ranbir's Tamasha for the umpteenth time this weekend, he has so much range, versatility. So much going for him, why did he choose such a dumb movie (no matter how big a hit they will shout and tell everyone it is). You are an amazing actor, but you are as good as the work you choose, choose wisely.",negative
10,Mindblowing Animal!,"Its hard to define 'Animal' in a particular genre. It's a father son story, it has action elements, romantics ones, its supposed to be mass entertainer but it also has this intelligence and class demanded by the script.Animal's core story is a son seeking his fathers' approval. There is a lot more sub plot apart from this, which elevates it from a simple film to something along the lines of Godfather.Acting:
Ranbir Kapoor is the best nepo kid actor in Bollywood for sure. This is a guy who might have been a superstar even without the Kapoor Lineage. This film has him play a similar dynast and it's a casting match made in heaven. Ranbir and the director takes his character and elevates the whole thing to another level. Ranbir's character Vijay often sprouts American terms since his upbringing has been shown to be in the states. It's a bit similar to Micheal Corleone who is raised up in Italy in the Godfather. Throughout the films various acts Ranbir is beyond rock solid. An acting tour de force. He has surpassed his peers by far.Anil Kapoor is solid and dependable as always. He plays the stoic no nonsense father figure to perfection and does not miss a beat. Overall his character is a bit similar to the one he played in Dil Dhadkne do, so this is not something entirely different than we have seen him play but whatever material he has been given, he does rather well.Rashmika Mandana, for me this actor is an eye sore. Neither is her expressions believable, her dialog delivery is pathetic and its actually difficult to make out what she is mumbling most of the time. The internet's trolling of her dialog delivery in the trailer is fully justified. Even during her introduction scene, she speaks like she has paan in her mouth. She definitely brings down the film, I am very curious to know why she has been cast in the first place! She is definitely the weakest link in this film. Any other actress would have been better than her.Shakti Kapoor has a brief role in the film and is surprisingly solid. His character is not very well defined, but this has to be the most sober role he has done in a while.The Music:
The songs make this film whole. Most movies like Jawan for example have good songs, but the songs are not the life of the film, in this the songs define the movie. Each and every song has its place and is there for a reason. Without them the movie doesn't work.The Action:
The violence in this film when it gets unleashed is on another level for a Indian film. Only Korean films can match this level of violence. So the A rating is justified. I wish to see the longer director's cut of this film and if that has even more gore and violence.Overall : The start and the end of the film CANNOT be missed. I can understand many missing the start, but how does one miss the ending? Well, most people started to leave when the credits rolled. But like a Marvel film, sit still. The movie doesn't end till the credits are done and then there one more scene. The movie is going in while the credits are rolling so it doesn't get boring. The audience that walked away at the start of the credits, doesn't know what they missed.So donot miss the ending of the film.Rating : 9.5/10. The first half of the film is a 10/10 for me. The interval block is beyond amazing. The second half does drag a bit especially Rashmika's scenes. So over the film is a solid 9.5 for me.",positive
1,Vulgar Movie Shame on you,"There was, in theory, no cogent plot. There were dialogues everywhere. Characters had strange conversations with one another. As in, each time someone spoke, the other would interrupt with a monologue about something unrelated. (For the most part ranbir).It differs greatly from the teaser. The story is not about a father and son. After the first few scenes, they didn't reveal anything more about their connection.Regarding content, Ranvijay was never able to provide a clear response to a query. He lacked consistency in his character. His behaviour must be constant, even if you create a bad persona. They want to convey the impression that he is insane and uncaring in one moment, but the next he would offer them forgiveness and protection.A film must have a narrative, a plot, and characters that make sense.It is not father son relation movie... Ot is purely a vulgar Movie.",negative
2,First half was decent second was awfull,The movie has a worst editing and storyline was mediocre. The scenes lost there context and start randomly. The only face saver was Ranbir acting. Even anil Kapoor seems to be overacting.The movie is below average and awfully long. The story could have been told in 2 hours. Some scene s were very long and sitting through them felt like agony. Action was unnecessary and fight sequences seemed like filler sequences. Also action gun fights all seemed like fantasy action..there was no realism. Finally dont go to watch it with your teenage kids. The movie is bad and doesn't deserve your money and time. If you still want to waste your time. Wait for it to come on OTT.,negative
1,Absolutely rubbish and not worth at all!,"I was so excited about this movie and I went to watch it todat and God what a worthless movie it was!What the hell was that movie all about? Absolutely no storyline, extremely violent and that too without any reason. As far as acting is concerned, it was good, but then again what is acting worth if the storyline is absolutely nonsense!It is humble request that please stop making such nonsense! People do not pay 300-400 rupees to watch something like this, I honestly regret wasting my money on this. Moreover, it felt like it was made in opposition to feminism, seems like some really felt agonized by the idea of it! Not recommended by me at all.",negative
1,Headache,"This movie gave just headache. Please watch at your own risk. What a load of rubbish, someone acting good can't save a movie without any real storyline and storytelling. It was too long with no real meaningful scenes, no scenes in the movie you would have a satisfaction that you have seen a good scene to remember. Only violence, violence and only violence. Very sorry to see the director thinks he has shown bold scenes but horrible to watch as nothing enhances the movie. Load of rubbish stiched together causing headache at the end. No words to describe the feeling to see they are planning for a sequels.",negative
1,Gu ka dhela movie !,One word to sum up the experience is Gu ! Gu ka Dhela ! Pathetic unintentional funny experience ! Nothing has changed in the universe. Ranbir Kapoor is still playing the same sob roles where he takes it seriously but movies are bad and Bobby Deol is still a bad actor. Songs and editing are specially bad. Vanga is a bad bad director working on a PR machine. Storytelling sucks as there is no story at all. When is Indian cinema going to learn and not copy the mindless movies created by Hollywood. Movie was as incoherent as this review and my headache. Nothing makes sense as I said gu ka dhela !!!!,negative
1,Worst movie I've ever seen,"""Animal"": A Critical Exploration of a Film Lost in SenselessnessAs I jot down these words amidst the second half of ""Animal"" unfolding on the big screen, my overwhelming sentiment is one of bewilderment. Who, in the realm of cinematic creation, birthed this perplexing narrative? The script, devoid of coherence, stands as a testament to senselessness, leaving me grappling with the bewildering plot-or rather, the lack thereof.At its core, ""Animal"" seems to revel in the absence of a substantial storyline. It's as if the creators tossed logic aside in favor of a chaotic collage of scenes that lack cohesion. A film should engage, challenge, and provoke thought, yet ""Animal"" seems content to meander aimlessly, leaving the audience with nothing to grasp onto.The script, a crucial backbone for any cinematic endeavor, emerges as the weakest link in this production. Dialogue exchanges feel forced, devoid of the nuanced subtleties that breathe life into well-crafted conversations. The characters navigate through a maze of inanity, their motivations and actions appearing arbitrary and detached from any discernible plot structure. It's a cinematic puzzle with pieces that refuse to fit together.The most disheartening aspect of ""Animal"" is its apparent catering to insecure masculine fantasies. The film lingers on tropes and clichés that perpetuate a narrow and regressive view of masculinity. Rather than offering a nuanced exploration of characters and relationships, it panders to a dated and one-dimensional perspective. This reliance on tired stereotypes does a disservice to both the audience and the potential the film may have had for genuine exploration and reflection.A film devoid of a compelling plot and meaningful character development can only sustain itself through other means-cinematography, perhaps, or a stellar cast. However, ""Animal"" struggles even on these fronts. The visual composition lacks a distinct identity, failing to elevate the mundane script into a visually arresting experience. Despite a cast that may possess individual talents, the collective chemistry falls flat, hindered by the weight of a directionless narrative.In the midst of this cinematic quagmire, it's essential to acknowledge that subjective preferences play a role in shaping one's perception of a film. Some may find solace in the visual aesthetics or draw enjoyment from the chaotic meandering, but for those seeking substance and coherence, ""Animal"" leaves much to be desired.In conclusion, ""Animal"" emerges as a film adrift in the vast ocean of senselessness. Its script, void of logic, and plot, caters to the lowest common denominator, perpetuating stereotypes that undermine the potential for genuine exploration. While a film can be forgiven for its shortcomings, the absence of a cohesive narrative and meaningful character development renders ""Animal"" a forgettable and frustrating cinematic experience. As the credits roll, one is left pondering not the intricacies of the plot, but the inexplicable choices that led to the creation of this cinematic enigma.",negative
1,Useless movie! slower than serial,"The first half is fine, story is somewhat engaging, but the second half is slower than serial. There's more of P**n than the typical ""animal"" behavior.And typical of Sandeep's previous movies, the heroine is useless. And senseless fight scenes, useless guns and shootings, hard to follow. Main villain comes only in the last 30 minutes, they fight for straight 6 - 7 minutes, what is this WWE? And nobody knows the reason for some of the fights.I guess this is a movie version of a typical soap opera. He should name it ""Movie to not watch"" instead of ""Animal"". Sentiment wasn't much. God knows how characters accepted such movie. So much of dragging, useless senseless kiss scenes that are out of place. Second half is just a synonym for headache. This has two heroines that have no purpose or place in the story. I still didn't understand what sandeep wanted to portray.Actual story can be completed in 30 minutes. Sandeep should stop making movies.",negative
1,movie with psycho character without story,Like Kabir singh this movie also don't have any story. Only psycho violent character development movie. I was expecting good story line but movie was disppointing. Acting in the movie is good but whats the use of acting if movie don't have storyine .Female character are there just for sex in the movie. Even animal planet channel having better story of animals. Director of the movie needs some mental treatment so that he can think something meaningful. If you compare to other action movies atleast they have some story and editing of the movie is stupid. In the end you will be like wtf we watched.,negative
1,Should have named it Physcho,"Movie is making crores, breaking Box Office records, but honestly it was too much of violence and misogynistic.Glorifying the movie in the name of actors best ever and Directors creativity is heights of Stupidity.What are they trying to tell the audience? Take the him and go on killing spree like a Physho? Very bad message to the society. Movie making is an art. How did they rate this 14? Did the censor board not see the ending scene?They are ending it with possible continuation for part 2 .... We should boycott the movie and not watch and not put money in these people's pockets.Totally waste of money and I cannot unsee some of the scenes.",negative
1,Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen,"I generally like all movies but this is the first time I walked out of the theater when seeing a movie. It was so bad.the hero is shown to be a hooligan ,a villain himself ,how do you root for someone so foul and conceited .Ranbir Kapoor has acted phenomenally to incite such dislike but I am someone who likes to root for the good guy and cannot stand gratification of hooliganism like this and male chauvinism at its worst. I have seen many many Indian movies with a lot of violence and liked all of them but the hero is always someone you can root for. My wife hated it too but watched the whole thing,she did say there was mindless violence and now is so upset she wants to cancel our AMC passes. I sat in my car for half the movie and just waited but it was better than seeing that mindless drivel ,I will never see a movie by that director again Vanga ,luckily I did not see Kabir Singh as I read the plot and I was not interested but I will never trust this director again.",negative
4,Weird !!!,"30 minutes in and there was one thought that was running through my mind. How I was going to sit through nearly 3 hour 30 minutes of this drivel. Disjointed story festooned with nonsense dialogues and songs during inappropriate times. Dialogues aren't random words thrown together to fill the void. It needs to have a flow and essence to it. This was missing.Through the movie Ranbir came across as a rebel without a cause always involved in knee jerk reactions. Most of the times his reactions and expressions were mismatched. Mandana far cry from her role in Pushpa seemed, just as out of place as her accent. So no surprise she spoke mostly in English which defeats the purpose. Besides Anil Kapoor, and a couple of known faces all the actors were unknown with not much of a screen presence and that didn't help either. This isn't a love of son-father, more like a son living in a make belief world of his and having a blind obsession for his father.All in all I didn't connect with the movie at any level couldn't wait for it to finish.",negative
1,Lackluster Film!!!!,"When did violence in films become a yardstick for assessing a movie's quality? I'm perplexed by the way violence is marketed like a potent drug in films, triggering a dopamine rush that fosters a craving for more. Those profiting from selling violence and those paying to consume it seem unaware of the ripple effect. Continuous glorification of crime and violence may eventually lead to a realization of one's contribution to societal issues. As the audience, it's crucial to recall the proverb, ""Fool me once shame on you, Fool me every time shame on me."" It's time to wake up and be mindful of the impact..While Ranbir Kapoor is a talented actor, this film doesn't seem worthy of his hard work and dedication.Such a lackluster film !!May the craft of filmmaking be blessed by the divine.!!!",negative
8,A film with some weakness but I'll watch again,Oh this is some film I had mixed feelings about . I mean first half is impeccable and I really didn't like some intimate or extra scenes which director included. The second half was over 20 minutes too long I am sure being director and editor he was having a hard time editing it but he really should have that is the only boring part . He will loose a lot of audience on that part but strangely I am recommending all my friends to watch it and after 10nyears it might be the first movie I'll reqat h again in cinema but that would be mainly due to songs and supporting actors . Ranbir is of course above the rim. The director needs to learn to cut scenes which are not needed . But why 10? Coz directors mistake ain't characters mistake. Bobby deol character was used extensively in trailer mr ranga reddy couldn't do justice to his role rather he spoiled my time in showing useless scenes of female lead in a bra and some other intimate scenes. May be he needs to get laid and get his frustration out I don't want to see same crap if their is a second part. Mr vanga get laid and focus on characters.,positive
1,Worst thing I had ever seen.,"The story is all over the place. He loves his papa 'Anil Kapoor' way too much but the character development for his papa (Which is the 2nd most important character in the movie because which movie is 3hrs 30mins long) is just flat dead. There is no character to his papa at all.The fight scene with Indian Gatling gun is nonsensically elongated and Ranvir's brethernes are just useless. Those 8 'mustandas' are there to sing a song while Ranvir does all his battles. Again, No character to them at all.Bobby, is there for a reason. He comes to a movie, kills a few innocent people, and dies. That is it. One of the worst final boss fights in a movie ever. I was so bored out.At last Ranvir comes forward with his father, does a papa-papa scene, I was like 'WHAT THE F--- BRO'.. I don't know what the director thinks. For 3 and some stupid hours, it was like a hot mess with stupid actions. SUDDENLY! Let's add some drama(for like 5-10mins) and 'THE END' with stupid mid-credits scenes.",negative

5,Too long and not enough action (or singing and dancing).,"A son's love for his father pits him against an anonymous assassin with a grudge.Animal is a whopping 3 hours and 22 minutes, and I don't think that includes the interval. The first half of the film is mostly overwrought familial drama and, to be honest, I was quite bored, much of the cultural stuff that seemed to be entertaining the largely Indian audience going way over my head. There weren't even any elaborate song and dance numbers to lighten the mood (I thought musical numbers were mandatory in Bollywood movies).I did, however, perk up when, immediately before the interval, the first action scene occurs, as anti-hero Ranvijay Singh (Ranbir Kapoor) hacks away at countless animal mask wearing enemy henchmen with a pair of axes before mounting a vehicle armed with enormous machine guns and blasting the remaining bad guys into oblivion. If this was an indication of the cartoonish OTT violence to come in the second half, I figured the hard slog of the past 90 minutes would have been worthwhile.Unfortunately, that blistering action scene proves to be the highlight of the whole film: the remainder of the film consists of more drama that seems to be building towards an exciting testosterone-fuelled climax but which culminates in a less than thrilling bout of fisticuffs between Ranvijay and villain Abrar Haque (Bobby Deol).5/10. I might have enjoyed it more if I had understood some of the humour, and, with such a long runtime, I think there should have been much more action, and at least one highly choreographed musical interlude (the song sung by Ranjivay's 'brothers' during the fight scene doesn't count).N. B. I loved the soundtrack, especially the spaghetti western style song Papa Meri Jaan and the haunting Hua Main - in fact, it is possibly the best thing about the film.",negative
1,TOTAL GARBAGE,"No story, No character development. Acting is just average. Unnecessary nudity. Glorified abuse especially to women. Filled with misogynistic jokes, a film made for today's Alpha males who's masculinity is just limited to assaulting women and fighting goons. This is the worst film of this decade come from Bollywoond industry.This film is totally waste of time, the length of film is literal snooze fest alongside it's crappy storyline. It seems like Ranbir picking a worse character than all the manchild and playboy he plays in mostly movies. The female leads are in the film for nothing but to make out. This is literally disgusting.",negative
1,"Senseless, Overhyped, Waste of Time, Insult to the hype created","Worst movies I have seen till date.Teaser and trailer are way different than what the actual movie is. 80% of Screen time is of Ranbir Kapoor, which you will feel irritated watching after some time. His acting feels good for first half hour but then it's same confused feelings on his face for the rest of the movie.Anil Kapoor did his job well, Rashmika was given a very stupid role which she tried hard but failed to perform.Coming to main part - Bobby Deol.He shared less than 5 mins of screen time in the whole movie but nailed out his character, can also say that he is the only person who kept movie watchable.BGM is too loud that you would miss hearing the dialogues.Movie floats in many different time zones which confuses the audience about what's going on. Worst Climax and post credit scenes.P. S.: If you are a woman, please skip this movie, women are portrayed in a very bad state.",negative
1,Waste of TIME and money,"Such a cringe and predictable movie from mister Vanga and somewhere looks like Ranbir is desperately trying to become a superstar. Is it Vangas direction or is it Ranbir's acting that is awful and over the top?Weak narrative. The movie is running on its strong background score and style factor, which too becomes bland after a while due to many fights and repeats. Also , feels like Ranbir is imitating Sanjay dutt from yesteryears. Not sure why Rashmika even picked up the role or why she was cast. I wish I had the option to rewind so I could understand what she's trying to say. Bobby deol and Anil Kapoor are the better looking actors in this movie, yet one struggles through the torture of 3.5hrs.",negative
1,Bollywood tries to make a South Indian movie,"Wasting talent like Ranbir Kapoor by casting him in a South Indian film. For the movie to work, it should have portrayed Ranbir as a meta or superhero to justify his action scenes.Imagine the richest man in India whose son aspires to be a gangster. If this were set in Ludhiana's affluent society, it would still make sense.If the main character is depicted as an individual with such ruthless tendencies, why did he choose not to torture the fake mole, but later, he is willing to harm a pregnant woman? This man, in the beginning, declares he will not deceive his wine but contradicts himself later.In reality, children with toxic fathers do not usually turn out to be such ruthless individuals. Although they may dislike their fathers, this movie seems to portray an exaggerated and overly dramatic scenario.",negative

1,Trash in Recycle Bin! What made Ranbir sign this movie?,"Long, Loud, Boring, Gory, Tiring. The movie starts off well, but turns out to be a disaster. The movie is a long drawn violent drama affair which doesn't end. Let's not talk about the story (there isn't one).Bobby Deol (the superstar of the 90s) is wasted, merely a cameo appearance and something his fans won't accept (no spoilers). Go watch his Gupt, Soldier, Ajnabee again!Ranbir's performance is fine, but being a mainstream actor of Indian cinema, should NOT have signed this torturous endless movie. I'm sure Ranbir will lose some of his loyal family fan base - but does it matter in the society we are living? I wonder if he read the script in full. His Shamshera is a far better movie than this so called Animal.At one of the marketing premieres for Animal, Ranbir said he prefers Sandeep over Rajamouli as the director. C'mon, Rajamouli Sir is one of the best directors India has ever produced and there is no comparison.If you are a hardcore Ranbir fan and would like to see Sandeep Reddy's Animal at any cost, go for it but don't forget to keep a Paracetamol with you.",negative
10,ANIMAL CRUElTY,"Perhaps the best movie of 2023 coming from bollywood hands down. A vicious and ferocious movie that delivers very well to those that understand the aim. The actor Ranbir gives a stunning performance very rare to see. The story is captivating and the direction is decent as well. The music, the rhythm of the music in the background scenes are superb. Am I giving this movie to much credit? No, I understand a good movie when I see one and this is a great movie. It gives you anxiety, gets your heart pulsing, and makes you dread what Ranbir will do next. You know when you have have given all your attention to one thing and you cannot focus on anything else. That's what this movie does. I won't spoil the movie or give anything away. Ranbir makes the best movies and he is the best actor in bollywood, no doubt about it.",positive
1,Why!?,"The existence of this movie seems rather questionable, as the creators seem to have grappled with a sense of confusion in determining a coherent pattern to follow. This uncertainty is palpable as they have amalgamated various elements, often resembling clear copies of the popular John Wick series. It appears they embarked on a venture of merging multiple templates, a creative endeavor that unfortunately culminated in a puzzling blend of disparate elements. Despite these shortcomings, it's worth noting that the movie does manage to salvage some positive aspects, particularly in the realm of its musical compositions, where certain songs stand out and contribute to a more enjoyable cinematic experience.",negative
5,Sadly a man's world isn't an excuse to not make a good film.,"Vijay (Ranbir Singh) is obsessed with his father Balbir Singh (Anil Kapoor), going to any extent to win his approval. Other than being extremely obsessed, Vijay is also an alpha male. The privilege he is born with, makes him be all the things he perceives to be the qualities of an alpha male. He goes conquering every he lays his eyes on except his father's approval. When Balbir Singh is attacked, Vijay comes back seeking vengeance and all hell breaks loose. Who attacked Balbir? What is their connection with Balbir's family? Will Vijay ever get tired of devouring his demons, forms rest of the story.Sandeep Reddy Vanga got triggered a lot due to the harsh criticism he received for Kabir Singh from a small section of critics and vowed to make the most violent film, which he succeeds. He didn't say anything about making a good film and that reflects in the second half. For what it's worth, the 1hr 45mins long first half was indeed terrific and Ranbir Kapoor is presented in never seen before avatar (not just Ranbir but any Bollywood hero in general). The non-linear narrative helps and so does the excessive violence. Everything Vanga has cooked up in the first half worked superbly.The second half is where the film stumbled big time as the weak script and barring Ranbir's Vijay, every other character being underwritten, badly pulls down the film. Excessive of everything will become unbearable and that is exactly what happens in the second half. Atleast the first half had hero elevations and gave him a purpose to help connect with the character. But in the second half, the writing undoes everything turning Vijay into this massive jerk than an animal and it is only Ranbir's performance that tries to be the film's savior.Speaking of underwritten roles, it is exactly here where Sandeep Reddy Vanga fails. Everything strictly remains on the surface level, be it the father-son relationship or husband-wife. We are told the reason for the enmity between Balbir's family and that of Abrar Haque (Bobby Deol) but it is never effectively established what their backstory was. It simply settles to bunch of wild nasty men going at each other with unnecessary amount of violence. Even Tripti Dimri's Zoya is so poorly written, the character's action at the crucial point made no sense whatsoever.Coming back to Vijay and Geetanjali's (Rashmika) relationship, it is somewhat an extended version of Arjun-Preeti / Kabir-Preeti though Geetanjali gets to take charge of couple of situations, only to give in. Just having the couple talk about their sex life openly or even fight using sex in the argument alone isn't enough to sell their love story. Anil Kapoor's Balbir sadly gets sidelined in the second half, only to get a proper scene in the end. All of this is what makes the entire second half feel so empty. But, the post credit scene was indeed very good.Overall, Ranbir Kapoor's terrific performance definitely deserved a better second half. I am going with a lenient rating just for that first half, Ranbir Kapoor and the post credit scene.",negative

1,WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!,"I recently had the unfortunate experience of watching a movie that was not only an abomination in terms of storytelling but also an exercise in excessive runtimes. The film in question was a seemingly endless marathon of nonsensical scenes, pointless dialogue, and a plot that could only be described as an insult to the art of storytelling.First and foremost, the story was so poorly constructed that it left me wondering if the writers had forgotten the basic principles of narrative coherence. The plot meandered aimlessly, lurching from one incoherent subplot to another, with no apparent connection or relevance to the overall story. Characters popped in and out of scenes with no clear motivation or purpose, leaving me perplexed and utterly disengaged from their fates.Furthermore, the individual scenes seemed to serve no function other than to waste precious minutes of my life. I struggled to find any semblance of meaning or significance in the endless stream of dialogue and action. At times, it felt as though the filmmakers were simply throwing ideas at the wall in the hope that something would stick, but alas, nothing did.To add insult to injury, the movie clocked in at an excruciating three-plus hours. Three hours of my life that I will never get back. I found myself checking the time, hoping against hope that the end was nigh, only to discover that I still had another hour of agony to endure. It was a cruel and unusual punishment, and I can only assume that the filmmakers were determined to test the limits of human endurance.The Climax Was So Bad With Silly Fight Scenes With No Point At All. Bobby Deol Has A Very Stupid And Weak Role In This Movie.",negative

6,🔴,"In the kaleidoscope of cinematic endeavors, this opus unfolds a narrative with commendable substance. While some elements may flirt with the border of realism, their allure remains undeniable. The characters, meticulously crafted, dance eloquently through a screenplay that, despite occasional lulls, orchestrates moments of brilliance. However, it does veer into excessive violence and sex at times, and the duration is overly lengthy.Ranbir Kapoor, a maestro in his role, etches an indelible mark through an amalgamation of impeccable appearance and an unforgettable performance.Anil Kapoor, in the paternal realm, delivers a virtuoso performance, while Bobby Deol, the on-screen sovereign, reigns with a captivating portrayal of the primary antagonist, albeit only in the last 40 minutes.Tripti Dimri is alluring and delivers a commendable performance.Enter Rashmika, the apt embodiment for a character demanding orchestrated disquiet. Yet, her artistry, mirroring her look, face, and voice, ventures into an unintended realm of vexation.Cinematography excels in many scenes but falters in a few. The VFX is also inconsistent, with some shots lacking quality.Locations, sets, props, costumes, makeup - each thread in this visual tapestry is finely woven, except for a few missteps.Songs take the audience on a melodic journey, swaying between highs and lows, while the backdrop symphony stands as a testament to musical prowess.However, editing poses an issue, as the second half is excessively lengthy and occasionally boring.In the directorial realm, Sandeep Reddy Vanga crafts a potent odyssey.

1,"Lame, derogative and too much violence.","The acting's great but the storyline's horrendous. It shows too much of blood and infighting, which I personally feel is not recommendable for people to watch. There's too much of obsession with son-father bond (kind of is derogative). Chances that people might even get false inspiration from the movie to portray those acts in reality. Likewise, the storyline features degrading personality of the character- innocent little kid to an early adult full of hormonal imbalances (which was great and intriguing) but suddenly to a criminal, killing and subduing counter parts without mediation and dialogues. The movie as well glorifies school shooting- a sacred sanctum of knowledge and learning. How did the CBFC even certify this movie without a proper screening of all those derogative scenes? Corruption?",negative

Ultimately the story starts from future with a narrative speaking some nonsense and which is no way related to the movie. Starting from that scene the story switches between timelines and making a poor viewer confused.

Apparently, his approach of any problem is sexual.First 1 hr I felt the narrative needed it to be twisted but going further into the movie just proved that there is no narrative at all.

8,"Had it not been for Ranbir Kapoor, rating would've been much less","I went into this movie expecting a never seen before story. The story was simple and nothin more than that but Ranbir Kapoor.... God damn man he is the best actor in India right now. He pulled it off with such ease and elevated the movie on another level. It is a well shot movie in my opinion and vanga has made a great movie to showcase the acting skills of such a great talent. The 1st half of the movie is amazing and goes with such smoothness. I felt the movie dip a bit in the second half and that romance angle could've been out to the side. Bobby Deol was a game changer but really underutilized. He should've gotten more screen time and a better backstory. Anil Kapoor as well was amazing and did a great job with his given role. The movie won't bore you at all because Ranbir Kapoor is taking up almost all of the 3 hours in this movie and he makes you wanna sit there and admire his work in each frame. The violence in the movie is gritty but not as much as I expected it to be. But overall, a good movie with great acting and also, do not take your kids. You will regret it.",positive
4,Illogical and arousing,"Let's discuss main characters first -
Ranbir's character in the first half is arousing, but magnetic and heroic because it shows high class status which is uncommon in the middle class society. But the problem is, it started getting over and the director can't balanced it out. Vanga is unable to carry that character for long in Ranbir and messed it. Most of the frames are filled with him only.Anil Kapoor didn't got much chance to perform. Although he made it through whatever chance he got but can't match with the family's physical build which represents punjabi community.Bobby deol did good acting but it's too short for a main villian and that is too when the movie is quiet big.I liked Shakti kapoor after a long time in a positive role but his character didn't suffice any purpose.Rashmika, Suresh Oberoi and Prem Chopra performed well.Storyline - It started well, and picked the pace but then before 10 min.

8,Absolutely loved it,"I was very apprehensive going into this movie cos of all the bad press around how women are treated in the movie etc. But, once I saw how Vanga has sketches out Ranbir's character in the movie, I was sold. I think people should stop equating movies to real life. Also, Ranbir is not a hero in this movie, he is a psycho who is constantly unhappy and living life in neglect and paranoia. Why are other reviewers saying he is eulogized? He is not. This is a movie about a guy who is nuts and if you see it from that perspective, you would like it too. Of course there is loads of collateral damage, but such is life if you choose to live with a psycho. The fights, the action, the whole gang, brotherhood, songs, everything was first class. I can't wait for animal park. Hope Bollywood can deliver such raw and unfiltered action again.",positive

Thought it would be good because of the good opening this movie had. Rashmika is so overrated. The plot is about a son who loves his dad in the most convoluted way. Such violence and contempt for life is very unusual. Please don't go and see this movie. Not worth your time or money. I just don't get it what was the director producers of this movie we're thinking making this gorie senseless movie. I hope fails big time at box office.,negative
1,Flop,"Mentally disturbing. No clear story. I would not recommend the movie. Only good thing about the movie is Satranga ishq song and the scene.

Ranbir's acting is phenomenal. But theme and story is horrible. Ranbir fights everyone for his father but listens to his advises zero times.Story: 2/10

Everything about the movie was carried out so well. The action, the bloodshed, the story, the songs, and the acting of all the actors in the movie was top notch. I do not want to get into spoiling aspect but please trust me when I say that this movie will be amazing. There is a lot of violence, sex references, and somewhat partial nudity so please be careful about who you watch it with. It is rated A (Rated R in North America) so some of you might not want to watch this with your families unless they are okay with these type of movies. Bobby Deol as villain was insane.

PLEASE DO NOT MISS THE CREDIT SCENE AT THE VERY END BECAUSE IT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. I give this movie a solid 10/10 and hats off to Sandeep Reddy Vanga for bringing us another banger movie after Kabir Singh🔥🔥",positive
1,All actors and director are mentally ill.,"After a long time I came to IMDB to write a review.This movie so so cringe. How can these famous actors sign up for this type of content...
Is it even a film? Seriously regret watching this piece. And how could Sensor board give permission to show this piece and allow them to steal people's hard earned money?? People like Ranbir Kapoor and Anil Kapoor has signed for this ... Can any sane person go and watch this? I can not imagine so. An actor like Anil Kapoor, who did so many beautiful films and have so much work like Night Manager and all, why?????Is only giving an (A) tag is enough...
Nonsense.",negative
1,Pathetic overhyped PR,"Surprisingly bobby deol is on a guest appearance, movie got poor storyline, flat screenplay, unnecessary action, too long,you can't have patience to bear this kinda movie even on OTT, BETTER to avoid from torture, better watch sham bahadur doe better acting, better content, logical classy flick , they are doing extra in pronotions, PR, MARKETING, making this movie overhyped without content , Ranbir kapoor just wanted to see himself as action hero, and that's undigestable, what will real action hero like akki, john, tiger, vidyut jamwal, hrirhik will do!!Within a week people will understand how good or bad the movie was inspire of fake pr.",negative
1,Not worth the hype,Movie is very boring. Not at all worth the hype.No storyline at all.Guns and crime is shown in a way that they own the world. No police no law and order.All actors did great acting but poor script and storyline wont help this movie run for more than a week.Biggest joke is they are coming with part two. Poor logic of clones used in movie. Bobby deol gets only fifteen to twenty mins of screwn time and that too without dialogues how sad.Initial few mins movie is good but then it gets totally distracted from the main plot.You need to keep your brain aside to watch this movie and also keep a medicine to help you in case of headache.,negative
5,"Animal, more like spoilt brat.","Not sure how you can call this movie a father and son movie, there are elements, only elements, otherwise this is a love and hate relationship.In India, only a rich man's spoilt brat can act the way Ranbir has in this movie, in fact I would not be surprised if he has based his character on an Indian tycoons or a politicians pathetic son. A spree of murders, and no sign of the police.Similar to the directors previous movie, the alpha male seems to be something he is fixated with, but his definition of an alpha male is bizarre, for him and alpha male talks about sex all day long, threatens women with slaps, and kills people. I wonder what type of a childhood Mr Sandeep Reddy Vanga has had.This movie, gets a rating of 5 from me the following reasons, an excellent soundtrack and the superb acting by Ranbir Kapoor, although I have to say his acting in Sanju was much better.I think the directors needs to visit a neural surgeon.",negative
1,Official nomination for the Worst movie in 2023,"I had to create IMDB account just to review this movie or whatever it was. Do yourself a favor and don't waste precious time of your life. Life is short, no need to waste it on this thing.There is literally no sense in this movie.I would like to personally meet the director and ask him not to make such movies.Imagine your version of a bad movie, now imagine 100 times bad version of the same movie. That's the gist of the movie. Guys, I am writing this movie while I am leaving the theater, save yourself the trouble of watching it..And if any of your friends or relatives like this movie, its time to leave them behind.",negative

1,Movie by the insanes for the insanes,"Director of the movie is mentally sick and more sick are the audience who are aplauding this movie. Post coolvid the Indian audience have lost their minds to promote crap and violent movies like this which has no story, thrill whatsoever. It start with KGF 2 the rollercoaster of such so called mindless action movies like Vikram etc. In all movies lead character keeps smoking, drinking, fkcing around and fights with 100 people alone. Then they have some scenes with machine guns firing at 100 of people and walking around nude. People keep Ranbir's career best performance, those people don't understand what acting actually means. Acting does not mean going around firing guns and stabbing people, growing long hair etc. Avoid this at any cost.",negative
1,Utterly nonsense half backed half written movie!!,Why editors were not hired to edit this 3.5 hour long non sense by producer. At least audience would have saved 1.5 hour of time . Somehow caste didn't watch movie after completing it otherwise they would have not allowed these scenes loosely stitched together to be released it as movie. Don't waste your time on it.While there is action no one knows why is it commencing in first place . Couple of good action scenes can't make up for plot and that has been ignored . Writing this review also waste of time but I hope at least one person reads it and save himself or herself from this stupidity..,negative
6,My god what toxicity!,"First thing it's a violent movie with lot of bloodshed, nudity, liplocks so much that at a point you may feel vomiting. It seems that all the characters live in some Utopian world where lawlessness is paramount. All the human beings are as good as machines ( which we all are becoming now a days) with zero sensitivity.As far as technical part is concerned it is brilliant. Acting of Anil Kapoor, Bobby an Ranbir are superlike. Female characters are just to satisfy their male counterparts. You feel they are just objects of senses.Even if you miss this movie you will miss nothing. You might save your soul from consuming some toxicity.",negative
1,"Very Hot Film & Similar To Pushpa, Kabir Singh, & KGF","The only actor I liked in this movie was Rashmika Mandana. Her acting & dialogues were top notch. Her voice was so sweet that you would require headphones to listen it in repeat mode, especially when you are watching the movie with your parents. And, if you go to theatre with dad, he's gonna stare at your face with red eyes, maybe you should wear helmet. If you have a girlfriend or boyfriend, then you can go and watch it. The looks of the main actor were similar to that of Pushpa and Rocky Bhai. The beard looked similar to that of Rocky Bhai and hairs looked like Pushpa, from two different movies and attitude looked like Kabir Singh. The makers thought, how about we create a fusion of Pushpa, KGF, and Kabir Singh? And the output was this lead guy in the movie Animal. The story turned my mind into half psycho. Like where do you get these ideas from? Totally nonsense. Rocky Bhai brought ""Badi Maa"" to become ""Bade Baap"" in KGF. The guy in Animal thought, I will multiply that by 3 and add three more Barrels to the LMG and then add a wheel to it, line up some masked goons, around 40 men, and roast them. SMH. And this was already shown in the trailer btw. No spoilers from my side. I was so irritated by the script. It's all beep words, like you can't write them here. The scenes are so hot and that's the only reason I gave this movie 1 star rating. Emotionless.",negative
1,Anymale,"Mr sanjeev vanga reddy finds the idea of alpha male so saleable that encourages him to make movies that are unabashed in their treatment of characters, optics and role plays that for any movie lover with even an iota of discerning taste is an assault on all his senses. This one, hoping that it touches all bases with any male, alpha or otherwise, is a hopeless mishmash of all the things wrong with a confused character who wants to tick all the boxes, a good son, a protector of family, a committed lover, a responsible husband , a guardian, a tycoon and a don, all at the same time and failing in each one of the roles by the end of it. The movie is a cringe fest and i shud hang myself in shame if i liked even a single part of the film. We men, have all loved our fathers wholesomely, whether they were rich or poor, but never like this. Men are as much rational as women are emotional, god bless them both and neither of them should be undermined but substituting one with other in a conveniently conceived contexts may be a populist cinematic tool but never the right one. Mr reddy, let me tell you, life imitates art, and despite your misplaced notions of art, this one is not, your film still is a threat to some impressionable minds. Even if
the responsibility of unabashed male violence of verb, emotion, demeanour or act, resultant of the movie can be pinned on you not , it will be a better world hopefully, of film watching, minus the characters devised by you, be it arjun reddy, kabir singh or vijay. Trust me, no male is like them in totality. And if, God forbid , what we see in your films is a projection of your own demons, God help you with some sense before you make another treatise on toxic masculinity without having any deeper understanding of it. If you are damaged somehow in your soul, pl dont take it out on us, the unsuspecting poor moviegoers.",negative
1,My benchmark for judging people,"Thank you Vanga and Ranbir Kapoor for this movie. It gives me a benchmark to judge people. In the past it was a bit difficult to find out what a person actually is. Whether they are intelligent or stupid, whether mentally stable or unstable, whether a good person or just plain psychotic.But now, I can get those doubts clarified by asking just one question. Did you like the movie Animal? If the answer is yes, then I know exactly the type that person is. So thank you Vanga and Kapoor once again for making this movie.What more do I say about this movie? Let's just say, it made me physically livid and disgusted to know that there are people writing stuff like this, there are people actually signing up to do stuff like this, there are people investing money in making this, and there are people who actually pay money to go watch this in theatres. And some actually enjoy this.There are good movies and bad movies. There are movies that trigger you, and movies that disturb you. There are movies that make you feel good, and ones that make you disgusted.I'm sad to say that Animal is not even fit to be considered in any of those categories.The future is definitely bleak for cinema and society, if movies like this are accepted and appreciated.",negative
10,MIND BLEW LIKE IT HAD NEVER BLOWN !,"For the starters I would say that you may love this movie or hate it, but you just can't ignore it in any caseFilm can be divided into four aspects - A) STORYLINE, B) ACTING, C) DIRECTION, and most importantly D) ACTION or VIOLENCE or simply BLOODSHED. Now below are my brief opinions on each of these aspects -A) STORYLINE - it is quite simple and mostly linear with few twists and turns. New is the father son bond that had long not been seen in any cinema. In this movie Mufasa and Simba get separated, but not for long, and what follows their union is mad mad love and madness around it.B) ACTING - acting by the cast makes this simple story very interesting and keeps you engaged for the entire runtime of the movie that is whopping three hours and 23 minutes plus few minutes of post credit scene which you can't simply miss and will leave you in awe. This role has evolved the actor in Ranbir as this one is no romantic and sweet Ranbir one is used to, this one's possessive, angry, masculine, and also, toxic. And he has played his role with absolute finesse. You get to see Rashmika's evolution too, which in latter half will leave you stunned. She has done a great job and looked pretty enough. Rest no one's average, and played their part well. Oh yeah Bobby's in here too, won't say much about him though, let it be a surprise and see it for yourself.C) DIRECTION - Sir, Sandeep Vanga Reddy had been quite upset or probably angry over the criticism his previous movie received, even though it became a box office success. However, this time he learnt the lesson well and guess what, he has responded back to the critics with a film that is even more toxic, masculine, violent and massy than his previous work beyond criticism. His direction is amazing. He has a knack for getting you engrossed from the beginning to the very end with his style of filmmaking that you start believing that you're a part of the events unfolding frame by frame and while sitting in the theatre through astral projection you've been transported into the screen and witness things right before your eyes and around you.D) ACTION/VIOLENCE/BLOODSHED - I've been fan of action and macabre stuff whether in movies or TV shows. But the bloodbath and violence that is present in this movie is unimaginable and unmatchable. This movie has for me taken everything to new bloody heights and raised the bloodied bar high enough. Before interval and nearing to climax and further it's a total RED ALERT. You may need a vomiting bag by the end. Anyway all in all violence is something that you may not like but believe me when it is not on the screen in this movie you will keep eagerly waiting for the blood to flow, muscles to collide, cuss words to be hurled at one another and sharp objects and bullets to cut and penetrate through the fleshes. It will keep the Dracula in you satiated for days.BLOODY GO FOR THIS MENACE CINEMA ASAP !!! AND DON'T MISS THE POST CREDIT SCENE !!!",positive
10,Great movies,"""Animal,"" starring Ranbir Kapoor, is a cinematic marvel that seamlessly weaves together riveting storytelling, exceptional performances, and breathtaking visuals. Kapoor's portrayal of the lead character is nothing short of brilliant, showcasing his versatility and commanding screen presence. The film's narrative unfolds with a perfect blend of suspense, emotion, and humor, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats throughout.The special effects and cinematography elevate ""Animal"" to a whole new level, creating a visually stunning experience. The attention to detail in bringing the animal characters to life is commendable, making them both realistic and endearing.

10,India's best action film till date.,"I walked inside the cinema with a lot of expectations and hope, to be honest their might have been a few flaws in the storyline but one thing it does not miss on is keeping the viewers on their toes every second until the very end to a point where after the movie it took me some time to come back to reality. I am not a big fan of action films but used to love those john wicks anyway, that said I never much enjoyed the Indian action genre with people flying around the room with punches and the hero being faster than the enemy's bullets but that is not the case here, there is a story line that stands its grown more often than not and there are strong emotional scenes that drive the movie to it's climax. Overall it was bang for the buck kind of an experience. Totally recommended.",positive
1,Pathetic movie - waste of time,"One star because Ranbir's acting was the only thing great about the movie.Poor direction, storyline, plot, and cohesion in the storytelling.I couldn't think of one good thing about this movie apart from the fact that I laughed once.Women are disrespected throughout the movie. A lot of the content in the movie is setting a poor example for the coming generation.Most importantly, the movie was based on father-son love, and there wasn't any story about that. Also, no emotions in the movie.I can keep writing about how horribly disgusting the movie was. Probably a lot of 1-star reviews talk about a lot of things.All 5-star reviews look stupid and meaningless, I guess all the fans trying to praise Ranbir that's all.The directors didn't only just make a poor movie, I made a poor decision buying a ticket for such a movie and wasted 3.5 good hours of my life.",negative
5,A Rated Family Drama,"The expectation from the film was sky high. Is it delivers properly what promised in the trailer? First of all if we look at the storyline, it's very simple. The plot of Animal delves into the intricate dynamics between Balbir Singh, a business magnate, and his son Arjun Singh. Following a tragic event in Balbir's life, Arjun embarks on a mission of revenge against his adversary Viraj Surve. He makes a solemn vow never to abandon his family, sparking a brutal gang war in the process. You can't find any complex twist & turns in the screenplay. But exution is pretty impressive. Ranvir Kapoor gives his best, especially he makes an impact on emotional scenes. The two long action scenes, the opening & interval are really humungous & violent. Overall I don't say it's a pitch perfect movie according to it's hype, but it's definitely a well made stylish action drama which can easily touches viewers heart. Some raw scenes added extra layer.",negative
1,Nearly died from boredom,"First things first the movie was boring. Forget about story, forget about the action forget about everything. The movie was just a hot mess of boring scenes jumbled together to kill the audience from boredom. The story was a mess, The characters were a mess, The dialogues were outright terrible.The only thing i felt while watching the movie was when was the movie gonna end. Generally I really like Bollywood movies cuz even if the stories aren't that well they're really fun to watch. But this movie had 0 things to redeem itself. It was nothing but a lengthy boring mess. The director and the writers really need to consider their job option if they're gonna release such a movie. Please do us a favor and change your career pls.",negative
9,It's Amazing Animal,"Animal , This movie is a modern Mahabarath a family rivalry. Stroy, Sandeep just nailed it and made the best master piece of his career,son's love for his father, relationship bonding with siblings, his love for sisters, wife and family. Ranbeer is as always the best at his acting career , he just gave an animal out of him to the audience. Bobby is the next one who gave his best , Anil as usual he is our Mr India at acting... Music is ok and short love story... I am sure you will enjoy the movie... the best part of the movie is parenthood which directly reflects on the mental behaviour of kids..",positive
6,I have a few reservations!,"So, I've finally returned home from the evening screening of ""Animal,"" and I have a lot to talk about, so let's get started.Positives:-1. Ranbir Kapoor - In a nutshell, fabulous! I've always admired this man and his natural acting abilities; Vanga has really taken him to the next level, and Ranbir has absolutely dedicated himself to the role he plays. You can absolutely question or even condemn the character for the choices he makes, but you cannot overlook the exceptional acting on display.2. Action & Violence - The second strongest aspect of this execution, and to be honest, we all knew it coming. Vanga pledged to deliver violence, and he kept his word. One of the most spectacular scenes of combat (the interval block) produced in Indian cinema. However, some viewers accustomed to Hollywood or international cinema may find the gore unsatisfactory!3. Confrontation Sequences - There are three main ones in the film (Ranvijay and Varun, Ranvijay and Geetanjali, and Ranvijay and Balbir), and all three had a tremendous impact on me. Wonderful work!Negatives:-1. Lack of Emotional Drive - There was enough of drama and tension in the narrative, with a revenge factor at the forefront, but I couldn't connect to the protagonist's motive or drive, or any of the other characters for that matter. This is mostly caused by a lack of emotional depth, which has robbed the narration of its desired attribute.2. Father-Son Dynamic Wastage - Every promotional material for the feature suggested a neatly constructed Father-Son relationship, with multiple layers and shades to explore and examine. However, that did not happen, and we were forced to settle for a one-dimensional portrayal of the said dynamic, which felt too banal, too rudimentary.3. Choppy Editing and Incoherent Writing - Those who know my film preferences and palate know how much I advocate for non-linear storytelling and experimental filmmaking, but that's only applicable if the script has a certain flow to it and the narration doesn't dither about its main course at play. ""Animal"" unfortunately loses its way in the middle, especially during the second half.Mixed:-1. Humour - A couple of lines made me laugh, but the rest of the lines constituted for comedy fell flat and looked unwarranted and out of place!2. Music - Songs like Arjan Vailly, Papa Meri Jaan, and Pehle Bhi Main matched the story gracefully and immediately pulled me in, but other tracks like Satranga and Saari Duniya Jalaa Denge were criminally underutilised.3. Bobby Deol as Abrar Haque - The look of Bobby created so much buzz on social media that a large number of people (including me) were ecstatic to see him in a dark, sinister avatar like never before, but Sandeep Reddy Vanga had other intentions. It's a shame to see a veteran like Bobby given only fifteen minutes of screen time, and that without the requisite amount of depth or context, resulting in a half-baked cameo at best!4. The Rest of the Supporting Cast - Rashmika, who played both the romantic interest and the wife, did a good job in a number of scenes (particularly near the end), but her character only had so much to express. Tripti Dimri, who played Zoya, had an even smaller role, which seemed unfair to me given her talent as an actor. Anil Kapoor, on the other hand, didn't have much to do except get upset and yell at his wife and children. Monotony hits again!Conclusion: If you know what you're getting yourself into, I feel you'll be able to get the most out of this show; if not, better to proceed with caution.",negative
1,Pathetic. 3.30 Hours with no storyline.,"Nothing against any of the Actor or the director but this was complete disaster.Saw the trailer and read the reviews, I was very excited for this but honestly I couldn't find a single scene with a proper storyline.I don't know what this hype is all about but I will never suggest anyone to watch this movie even once and waste their time.Movie starts with violence and ends with violence but never understood the necessity all this at any point of time. The trailer was great and I actually thought that they might created something good but nothing was good apart from the trailer.Bobby was given very less screentime and that too without any context.Watch at your own risk guys.Thanks.",negative
1,BIG WASTE OF TIME,"This movie is such a disgrace for Bollywood. I tired very hard to find ONE positive thing about this movie and failed miserably.First of all other than the main leads the acting of others was terrible
Secondly the story and plot is completely nonsense!! This kind of story will encourage one to be disrespectful toward others!And if you say movies are for entertainment then this movie successfully failed in that area too!This movie is supporting that ""it's okay to cheat if you have no other option"" well in my opinion cheating is not an option or solution! Such utter nonsense!I don't think in 2023 we need to encourage this kinda behavior. This movie is a DISGRACE!",negative
1,Cringe Fest: Worst Movie of My Life,"Animal is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. There is no story. It is full of nonsensical scenes that is so unnecessary in the movie. I felt no emotional connect with any character. Just for the sake of making a violent movie, the director added killing, bloodshed, nudity and infidelity without any reason. The film tries to force the 'baap beta' angle throughout without establishing any authentic father son relationship. In the end, we were laughing at the violent scene. It felt so stupid. There wasn't a single hooting, cheering in the theatre becoz there was nothing to like. Even the revenge scene in the end could not bring a single cheer. So bad! 2nd half is cringe fest and utterly utterly misogynist . I wonder why Ranbir Kapoor did this. Is his career at such a low that he has to take support of such trash? Worst movie choice ever!",negative
2,"Weak Story, Action, and Acting Overshadowed by Music.","""ANIMAL"" disappoints with a confusing story, unimpressive action scenes, and over-the-top moments. The film suffers from a lack of coherence in its storyline, with events unfolding without a proper sequence, leaving audiences disoriented.The acting isn't great. Exaggerated elements further dilute the impact, rendering crucial moments less believable.The only highlight is the music, but you can listen to that without going to the theater. With platforms like Spotify offering easy access to music, the appeal of the soundtrack becomes less of a draw for a theatrical experience. The cinematic medium demands a harmonious blend of various elements, and in the case of ""ANIMAL,"" the music alone cannot salvage the overall viewing experience.Save your time and money.",negative
4,Watching this movie is an act of disservice to the society,"Leave alone message, what is the point the makers want to convey? Smart they are, they cashed on the baser insticts of the masses and on the dormant masses hidden in the so called elite. Add the scenes and dialogues to cater to the animal in the unthinking today's gullible viewer, some attention--gripping scenes subtly plagiarised from Sorcesce Torentino movies, plenty of gore, that is Animal for you.Leave the psychological baits, and the magnetic screen presences of the protagonist and the antagonist, only then one can see the holes in the writing.The story is supposed to have been pivoted on the father-fixation. Given the treatment the son received from father during his teens and adulthood for that matter, the massacre-the-world-for-father is baseless and sick--so is the murderous rivalry in the family. You slit any number of throats, you get away and become more adorable hero.Every rupee spent on watching this movie, directly and indirectly, is an instrument in polluting the contemporary human psyche.Alas, the movie is a superhit. With a heavy heart, I expect the arrival of more horrible and tasteless movies in the horizon.",negative
1,What did I just watch,"Save yourself 3.5hours of your life; run the other direction like the heroine does in the end. First half is a little bearable but the second half is absolute torture. Acting is ok but the storyline, plot, direction doesn't hold up at all. It's a waste of time. Bobby deol is good. Anil Kapoor yells the whole time. Ranbir's character is so confusing and unnecessarily so complicated. How is this even a movie? Director wants to make something but doesn't know what it is; everything is just for effects and mainly tiring to watch. Gore is unnecessarily glorified. Not sure what any female actors are doing in the movie and not sure what the males actors are doing either lol.",negative
1,Boring and low grade movie,"I watched the movie Animal, and I was very disappointed by it. I enjoy action movies, even if they are violent or gross, but this movie was neither thrilling nor entertaining. It was a poorly made movie with no plot, no character development, and no respect for women. Here are some of the reasons why I did not like this movie.First of all, the movie was boring and headless. It had no clear story or direction, and it seemed like a random collection of scenes with no connection or purpose. The movie tried to be a neo-noir film, but it failed to create any suspense or intrigue. The movie was also very predictable and clichéd, and it did not offer any surprises or twists. It was very obvious and unoriginal. It was just a copy of many other movies that have done the same thing before.Secondly, the movie was frustrating and senseless. It had no logic or consistency, and it did not follow any rules or laws. The movie was full of plot holes and contradictions, and it did not explain anything or make any sense. The movie also had no moral or message, and it did not have any redeeming qualities or values. The way it portraits woman for no reason was very disturbing and pointless. It was just a gratuitous display of violence and misogyny, and it did not serve any function or meaning in the movie.Thirdly, the movie was disrespectful and harmful to women. It portrayed women as objects and slaves, and it did not give them any agency or dignity. The movie also glorified and normalized the abuse and exploitation of women, and it did not show any consequences or justice for the perpetrators. For example, the scene where . It was just a way of showing Ranveer's power and dominance, and it did not show any remorse or regret for his actions.In conclusion, I think Animal is a bad movie that should not be watched or praised. It is a waste of time and money, and it is a negative influence on the society. It may appeal to some people who like violence and gore, but it does not have any artistic or cinematic merit. It is a shame that the director, who made a decent movie in the past, has stooped so low and made such a trashy movie. I hope he will learn from his mistakes and make better movies in the future. I also hope that the audience will be more critical and discerning, and not fall for the hype and glamour of this movie. I would rather watch Mad Max: Fury Road or John Wick, which are much better action movies that have a plot, a character, and a respect for women.",negative
1,Chaotic Chronicles of Vanga,"Animal is a perplexing cinematic journey that embraces random plots, showcasing a lack of coherence that leaves the audience bewildered. The film's reliance on gratuitous gore not only overwhelms the senses but also adds little substance to an already convoluted narrative.Unfortunately, the movie is marred by elements of misogyny, perpetuating outdated stereotypes that detract from any potential enjoyment. The bad direction is evident in disjointed scenes and erratic pacing, leading to a viewing experience that feels more like a series of unrelated events than a cohesive story.Speaking of the story, Animal fails to deliver a compelling narrative, leaving audiences questioning the purpose of the film. The inclusion of Rashmika and Tripti as seemingly unnecessary characters adds to the confusion, with their roles contributing little to the overall plot.The inexplicable obsession with the Dad character is never adequately justified, leaving viewers struggling to connect with the characters on an emotional level. Furthermore, the film takes a disturbingly casual approach to violence, equating the act of killing people to swatting mosquitoes, which may leave audiences questioning the ethical boundaries of the narrative.The inclusion of international murders that characters inexplicably get away with adds an unsettling layer to the film, lacking any semblance of consequence for their actions. The film's tendency to introduce very random scenes further exacerbates the overall sense of chaos, making it difficult for viewers to stay engaged.In conclusion, Animal is a cinematic misstep that suffers from random plots, excessive gore, misogyny, bad direction, a lackluster story, and unnecessary characters. Its attempt to justify an obsession with a character falls flat, and the nonchalant approach to violence and international crimes may leave audiences questioning the film's moral compass. The haphazardly placed random scenes contribute to an overall sense of confusion, making Animal a challenging and unsatisfying viewing experience.",negative
4,A Deceptive Mirage Veiled in Misogyny,"From the outset, the film captivates with its stunning cinematography, drawing the audience into a world shrouded in mystery and intrigue. The narrative unfolds around a male protagonist whose charisma masks a sinister agenda, a trope that perpetuates the insidious belief that charm excuses reprehensible behavior. However, this very charm is wielded as a tool of manipulation, effectively gaslighting both characters within the story and the unsuspecting audience.One of the most distressing elements of ""Shadows of Deception"" is its endorsement of misogynistic ideals, disguised within the plot. The female characters, regrettably reduced to mere plot devices or caricatures, are subject to objectification and belittlement. Their portrayal reinforces outdated and damaging stereotypes, detracting from any semblance of a progressive storyline. A fiction, as an art form, should not serve as a vessel to perpetuate regressive attitudes or normalize the denigration of any gender.Moreover, the action sequences, while initially promising to elevate the narrative, instead derail it, plunging the audience into an over-the-top spectacle that disrupts the flow of the story. The incessant barrage of high-octane sequences overwhelms, eclipsing the depth that could have been cultivated within the plot and character development. The constant bombardment of action undermines any potential for emotional investment, leaving the audience detached and disengaged.The film's direction and screenplay, though attempting to weave an intricate web of suspense, ultimately falter in their execution. The convoluted narrative fails to offer substantive explanations or resolutions, leaving audiences perplexed and unsatisfied. The promise of a gripping storyline devolves into a labyrinth of confusion, leaving viewers grappling for coherence amidst the chaos.",negative
1,Worst movie of all time #WOAT,The director has proven that he doesn't know how to make a film...trying to using the same formula as it was in Kabir Singh but multiply it by 10x. Super awful movie..I walked out of the theatre midway.Ranbir acting is good otherwise its a pure waste of money ..people should watch Sam Bahadur instead of this wicked movie.The editor should be fired for not editing enough and the director..this would be his last piece which I would be watching. The story and screen play is seriously ridiculous. I seriously don't know how this movie is even selling tickets. This is the worst of all time movie #WOAT.,negative
8,Animal Breaks Chains of Political Correctness!,"Director Sandeep Vanga Reddy, often accused of ruffling the feathers of self-proclaimed ""liberal critics"" with his films like Kabir Singh and Arjun Reddy, appears to have taken the criticism to heart and birthed a film that is unapologetically raw, intense, and unabashedly violent.Ranbir Kapoor's portrayal of ""Animal"" is a true tour de force. He effortlessly navigates between ferocity and vulnerability, crafting a multifaceted character that keeps the audience captivated from the opening scene to the closing credits...A standout feature for me is the director's choice to confront the critiques of his past works by offering a more substantial characterization for the female lead, played by Rashmika. In the second half of the film, Rashmika delivers an unexpected and impactful performance.The exploration of the relationship between father and son adds an emotional depth that goes beyond the superficial intensity. The tribute to The Godfather was rather nice.Ps: The only criticism I have is of Tripti's character. I wish there was more of her...",positive

1,Illogical portrayed father-son relationship,"Unsure of the reason showing ultra rich family with westernised lifestyle wearing Tikka on forhead especially when arguing. Extremely Bad repesentation of society. May be this is the case in Kapoors and Vanga families.Unsure why they choose Bobby for only 2-3 scenes.Rashmika's role is also confusing, or Vanga did not like her to perform weell to keep Ranveer on limelight.If you like Hollywood violent movies, this is definitely not a movie for you. Because those movies has some kind of base and reasoning about director is potraying it as violent.If you want, watch it when it will come in otp instead of spending money and 4 hours in theater.",negative

2,Yeh movie hi rog hai. A complete let down.,"To everyone who wants to watch this movie, just go to your instagram reels and watch some action scenes of this movie as thats all there is to this.This is just a very bad movie with good actions scenes. Anybody who calls this an amazing movie or a ""paradigm shifter"" for bollywood is either too carried away by their fandom of the starcast or is pretending to be a cinephile and trying to gloss over the bad direction and storyline (or lack there of). It was quite evident that the director was trying too hard to give off an indie director vibes by having random scenes with completely unrelated BGM playing.All that being said, Ranbir has given probably his career best performance in this, the action scenes were amazing & the entire cast played their roles superbly. Bobby was criminally underused but still was the highlight of this abysmal film.",negative

8,"Animal: A Cinematic Journey of Emotions, Brilliance, and Musical Magic","Animal is a cinematic rollercoaster that skillfully blends gripping direction, powerhouse performances, and a pulsating soundtrack. The first half is a masterclass in storytelling, with the director Sandeep Reddy Vanga weaving a tapestry of emotions and suspense. Ranbir Kapoor and Anil Kapoor steal the show with their exceptional performances, marking a significant comeback for Ranbir. Their on-screen chemistry adds depth to the narrative.The film's second half, however, loses some momentum with a slower pace, leaving the audience yearning for the intensity of the initial scenes. Bobby Deol's limited screen time is a missed opportunity, as his presence adds a compelling layer to the plot. Despite this, the stellar performances from the cast elevate the movie, with Ranbir Kapoor delivering a particularly impactful portrayal.Rashmika Mandanna falls slightly short of expectations, leaving room for improvement in her character portrayal. Shakti Kapoor, although a veteran actor, could have been given a meatier role to showcase his talent.The music is a standout feature, with Ajay-Atul's compositions creating a mesmerizing atmosphere before the interval. B Praak's song during a pivotal fight sequence is a stroke of genius, showcasing innovative thinking in the film's soundtrack. The cinematography by Amit Roy and editing by Sundeep Reddy Vanga contribute to the film's overall appeal.The intricate plot, spanning over 201 minutes, unfolds with layers of family dynamics, love, betrayal, and revenge. The post-credits scene sets the stage for potential sequels, adding an extra layer of intrigue for attentive viewers.In conclusion, ""Animal"" is a cinematic experience worth the watch, despite its flaws. The exceptional direction, standout performances, and memorable music make it a compelling addition to Indian cinema.",positive
10,Absolutely loved it! If possible watch in theatres. Sandeep Vanga completed his promise!,People really need to understand the character can be problematic and yet the movie can be loved! Also it's high time we as an audience realise that it's not actor/director's responsibility of what audience is deciding to learn from their movies. So yes the Character was problematic but it's just another fictional character and shouldn't be glorified also not crucified.Now coming to the movie went to first day first show and had high expectations but I am totally satisfied. I am not a film critic I am just a normal guy who loves movies so can't go deep into analysis but here goes my review!The show was housefull as expected and atmosphere was electric! Even during intermission I could easily hear other talking about how they are loving the movie. The movie is indeed very long and I will agree second part feels stretched but it's not as bad as many people are suggesting.Songs are good and music is engaging. Watching Marathi song in fighting scene took me by a surprise and whole theatre enjoyed it!Ranbir have done phenomenal job and he is going to win bunch of awards for this role for sure. Rashmika+Ranbir combo was good but felt the chemistry could have been better. Bobby was criminally under utilised but he was top notch. Shakti Kapoor's role was very useless and couldn't grab any attention at all. Anil Kapoor was brilliant and his emotions could be felt by everyone watching.A worthy mention is small cameo of Upendra Limaye! He got a huge cheer the moment he arrived on the big screen. He showed his acting calibre in just 5 minutes. I really hope more Marathi actors like him get chance to show their craft in Bollywood.If possible go to theatres. I also believe it's rating will take a hit once it's released on OTT. People who watched in theatres and those who will watch it on OTT will have different opinions about this movie.,positive
10,"Never seen before masterpiece - ""ANIMAL""",This movie is really one of a kind in terms storytelling as well as the action and character development. Really liked this movie because there is no sugar coating and everything is as it should be. Ranbir portrays the darkness that people have within them very well and this just showcases what a person can be capable of if he really puts his mind and soul to it. Talking about the characters Ranbir Kapoor and Rashmika Mandana nailed it. Anil Kapoor and all the other actors did a fantastic job. The direction is next level and it really brings the movie to life. From the start to end this movie has kept me glued to my seat. The movie is a blockbuster and I personally would like to watch this masterpiece again. Really brilliant movie by Sandeep Reddy Vanga no more words to describe it.,positive
10,Best actor,"Animal film starring Ranbir Kapoor, is an absolute cinematic triumph that captivates audiences with its gripping narrative and stellar performances.

6,Watch it for Ranbir kapoor else don't waste your money.,"All were saying that vanga clearly revealed nothing in trailer. But the truth is there was nothing to be revealed, A very very basic story of a dad son relationship which you can see in every other movie. Action scenes are made brilliantly. Bobby Deol has a cameo and because there was not much character development for him he looks useless in those scenes. Anil kapoor did act well with limited screen time he got. But there is no twist and no turn basic masala movie with lots of action and no emotion values. If you are Ranbir fan than watch it your hero has done wonders in acting. Rest of the people can wait for Netflix release of the film.",negative
1,Utterly Disappointed!,It's one thing to know how to shoot nicely and show grandeur on screen. It's totally another thing to connect to all kinds of audience. I made a huge mistake trusting the hype around this flick and booked a cheap ticket to watch it in a theater. I laughed once during Jerry's (the Marathi arms dealer guy) act. That was the only reaction the film drew out of me. Everything else was like boring and something which didn't really. What's a movie in which all the actors act well but the plot is really bad. It's a bad movie! Sorry not sorry. I felt that we can produce mature cinema in India but etc!!,negative
9,After BAHUBALI this is good indian movie i've watched.,"Adter a long time back watched a good film, watched with like 500 people at the theatre and every moment was worth it. Director really had an clear vision how the story goes in the movie. You can't expect what's gonna happen next and that the beauty. Although like any otter movie its also not free from its drawback. Like 2nd half is little stretched out, some dialogue could have been precise, in one fight scene even though ranveer had supporter he killed 200 people with an axe which was little hard to consume. But rest all everything was perfect. Cinematography, the wow moments, the amazing story, the punjabi swagger vibes, guns, background music, director vision, the transitions, costume etc are all everything are perfect done. Some dialogue are so punching that watching with 500 people when everyone laughing really made the vibes soo good. Watched it and banglore and there is a dialogue that says imagined in delhi, manufactured in BANGLORE, assembled in mumbai, (atmanirbhar bharat); when people heard the word banglore people really screamed and i got goosebumps from it. Dialogues are not that filmy, not that typical movie dialogue, its all genuine.Nowadays most of indian movie gives kind of a vibes of south india movies but this movie was different, it didn't had that south vibes rather delhi and punjabi vibes fully. Movie enthusiasts must watch this without reading further more review and trust me you won't regret your time. My day has really well spend today all i am saying.",positive
1,Very gory,Too many violence scenes and repeated bloodshed takes life out of what could have been a good movie. Even to the very end there is enough butchering and mayhem just to keep the tempo of violence up to the throat. To top it there is an indication of a sequel at the end. The plot looks inspired by The Godfather specially with the car bomb scene. There are few takeaways in the first hour where the character of the protagonist is being built but after that there is just insane level of killing with zero thought on why. Clearly disappointed with the movie and hope people stay away from such violence.,negative
6,Ups and downs,"I was really excited to watch this movie from the day it's trailer was revealed. The movie had it's ups and downs but the downs are more.The story was simple but it's execution was below average, the screenplay was below average as it was unnecessarily stretched, the direction was good and the performances were great especially Ranbir Kapoor who nailed his role. The action sequences were great and uplifts a boring story.Everything was going right till the interval and then came the second half which was boring, unnecessarily stretched and poorly executed.Overall, you can give this movie a try but don't keep your expectations high. You might get disappointed.",negative
1,Don't watch this kind of BAD MORAL movies.,"Though as a movie its great, but teaches bad things.These things will influence you for sure even its percentage is 0.01%. When the teaser came out , i was so excited for this movie. But moral of a movie is important to me , and i guess a lot of people feel like me. Many of people watched this around me and already being influenced by this type of character which is bad for society. Many people says movie is movie, but i can assure you that every person gets influenced by any movie , for some its more , for some its less , but its sure.My recommendation is stop watching this kind of movies and
KEEP YOUR BRAIN CLEAN AND HONEST.",negative
9,I am awestruck,"What a an amazing movie. I have never seen such a close to perfect hindi movie for a very long time or ever. I felt all the emotions fun, anxiety, sadness, rage etc etc. Superb performance by everyone including the ones who played the small roles. It's a must watch but only for Adults. Though this is not for everyone, being that said it's experience would be 10 times better in the theaters. The background music the action sequence the intensity of the scenes.Simply amazing. Easley the best work of Ranbir Kapoor so far. Rashmika Mandhana did really well as his wife as well as Anil Kapoor pulled off an epic performance.",positive
8,C's review - worth the watch,"Verdict: ""Worthu Varma Worthu""... This is how a movie should be made - a full-time entertainer. The first half is mind-blowing with amazing music/Bg score, first-class direction, and kick-ass performances. Starting with the director, who has yet again delivered a blockbuster after Arjun Reddy. The bg score elevates the movie, and Ranbir Kapoor's goosebumps-inducing acting makes the combo worth watching on the big screen. Despite a lack of a strong storyline and concept, the overall presentation and the makers' efforts made me enjoy the movie thoroughly. Flawless action, costume, make-up, and art direction, along with engaging dialogues, screenplay, and characters, contribute to elevating mass and heroism throughout.",positive
8,Vanga slaps with this film and Ranbir just exceeded himself.,"Animal is a film where the director's presence is always felt on the screen, like a Hirani or Imtiaz has a mark on their work, Vanga is about strong impulses, snappy dialogues, and unflinching honesty. For Vanga diplomatic politeness is the actual red flag that is the root cause of our shallowness in human relationships. You can't not think of Kabir Singh how the protagonist is so good academically, physically, financially that he occupies his territory as an unflinching force and you can feel in your bones if you've touched the flesh of life that some of it is desperately needed in the world.",positive
8,INSANE!!!,"What a brilliant performance by Ranbir. Absolutely thrilling. The direction is on par as well.I know this is a long movie and some action sequences do seem like a lot but the director remains successful in keeping the audience hooked. Kudos to the music director for amazing score and sound effects. The ending was totally surprising. I am so glad there were no unnecessary songs or item numbers.As the movie is rated 18 plus, it should definitely be considered before planning to go to the theater because the language, violence, and sexual references are intense. I am so excited for the next part.All in all, two thumbs up!",positive
7,A Violent Gore Massacre cinema popping up with polarised opinions,"ANIMAL has been watched & this was one of my most awaited movie for this year, so here are my thoughts about it :If Rockstar & Tamasha weren't enoughly polarising, here is another one for you by #RanbirKapoorYOU'LL EITHER HATE IT OR FALL IN LOVE WITH IT.I loved it for the most part but I still have my grudges as I was convinced after watching the trailer that it is going to be a 5/5 movie hands down but sadly it isn't.Won't dive into the plot as it is majorly clear based on the trailer.Performances
Ranbir Kapoor : This man has made a movie for everyone, for one ADHM I did not like he made a TAMASHA & yes we all became his fans sooner or later & this time he has gone an inch above & given a top notch performance, he is representing multiple phases of his life as a school kid, as a college kid, as an assassin killing people, as a husband & in each role we cannot take our eyes off screen that is the benchmark of his performance and it comes with no surprise that we expected the same from him & he had to deliver it.Anil Kapoor : He is Jhakkas, he is shown as a father who has always been neglecting his son & yes you tend to develop a hate for him.Bobby Deol : You gotta be kidding me if I say that he wasn't working much in past few years, man he deserves some good scripts & needs to continue working with directors who can take out the best from him, he was robbed with screen time here & was more in an extended cameo role rather than what everyone expected, but whenever he comes up on screen he seems to be ruthless killer machine.Rashmika Mandana : While everyone made memes out of her one dialogue she actually surprises in the movie & she has been given multiple important acts where she proves her potential as a good actor, you need to see the scene where she tells Ranbir that he is fighting ghosts in his mind.Tripti Dimri : She didn't had much to do here but definitely is gonna be a big highlight in the upcoming sequel and her presence in this part was a build up for the next.Shakti Kapoor/Suresh Oberoi/Prem Chopra/Saurav Sachdeva all had small roles & they all looked stellar.Direction and Screenplay : Kabir Singh director was coming from a lot of hype & he had to prove that he was worthy of all that hype & yes he is, challenging to keep the runtime of over 3 hrs was a bold move, screenplay was engaging, Vanga made sure that the audience remains connected with twist turns up-till the end despite long runtime & he was successful, the cinematography was top notch especially in the action pieces be it Arjan Vailly sequence, Ranbir-Bobby Airstrip fight sequence, Ranbir chasing eve-teasers in an Endeavour, the sunrays striking Ranbir's eyes with shadows covering the remaining body in a G-Wagon & lots more....brilliant, the gore shown in the movie is the actual substance audience expects from a violent film rather than people jumping here & there after a gun shot which Sandeep was able to create perfectly, song placements were spot on especially the B-Praak's song which just played with the emotions with such strong lyrics from Jaani, colours were vibrant throughout the film & pleasing to eyes & even adopting colours to the screen such as during Arjan Vailey song covered with blood bath with a red screen, Kudos to @imvangasandeep for another success based on his instincts which worked big time.Songs : All the songs are good & none of them feels like a forceful addition, highlights for me were Arjan Vailey & Saari Duniya Jaala Denge, and the BGM was just thundering and was effectively used based on the scenes.Goods/Bads : While the movie is solid on story with enough twist & turns & keeps you engaged for most part you might feel some scenes as going on forever which might have required some trimming, and also you criminally under utilised Bobby Deol, he deserved a large screen space for the audience to feel more connected to his anger & that could have made the final battle even much bigger but still the movie with it's little flaws is a MUST WATCH on big screen.RATING : 4/5A generous additional .5 rating for Ranbir & Bobby Deol's characters.",positive

7,Sandeep Reddy Vanga - Desi Tarantino!,"Like a Tarantino film, Sandeep Reddy Vanga's Animal (2023) is unconventional and non-conforming. An intense family saga full of emotions, drama, romance, vengeance & loads of blood, gore and graphic violence.A Tarantino film is deviant art. He knows how to feed his audiences, and when to pull the plug! Our Desi Tarantino falters a bit.Ranbir Kapoor in a never-seen-before avatar is like 'Michael Corleone' in a 'Tarantino film'. He shoulders the film entirely. Had any other actor played Ranvijay, this film would have bombed and sunk without a trace. It was that dicey.Anil Kapoor is stellar. Rashmika shines.Bobby Deol is mesmerizing but he was underutilized. In fact, he should have been introduced in the first half of the film itself and given a longer screentime. The honeytrap sequence of Tripti Dimri in the second half would have then stuck nicely.The film has its moments and sparks of brilliance. The first half is racy and engaging but the second half nearly falls apart. A good storyline falters because of inept writing and bad screenplay - a missed opportunity for being a great film! The story could have been easily told in 2-1/2 hours. Right now it's a bit tedious making it less enjoyable. The BGM and songs are too good.It's bad economics alienating family audiences. In keeping with his image, Telugu superstar Mahesh Babu was definitely right in refusing to do this film.Like Arjun Reddy (2017; Kabir Singh 2019), Animal (2023) is bound to evoke polarizing reactions!Sandeep Reddy feeds on man's deepest fears, perverse fantasies, erotica, and inhibitions, which are buried by the mandates of society. By addressing these intimidating and often embarrassing situations without any moral pretense, he portrays a human world that is bold, unafraid and undogmatic with all of its flaws, at times bestial. Welcome to the Vanga-genre!",positive
10,MEGA HIT,"This is going to one of the best movie of Indian Cinema History very soon. It is multidimensional movie, it has all movie elements - Action, Romance,Thriller,Music. Its central core strength is the Action portrayed, especially in Ranbir Kapoor fighting scenes(not that Bobby Deol scene) there is much more fighting visuals than that. When it comes to action, it will beat all Indian movies ever produced such as KGF,RRR, Tiger Zinda hai. Cinematography is mind-blowing, you would have never seen such in Indian movies. This movie act as an under dog, before 1week trailer got released, now movie blast.",positive
8,Watchable Psychopath story,"First half peaks, second half lot of psychoism. Movie is portrayed as father son love story. Where as Rashmikas love was more powerful. Character selection was too good. All main characters and side characters from Mishra to translator were well established and has value. Background score elevated scenes to peak. Ranbir did excellent acting as well Rashmikas. Anil Kapoor did excellent job showing his mood in expressions as a concerned father with fear inside and brave heart outside. Bobby deol too was excellent in his brief presence. Overall it's a different psychic experience and only for adults, when it comes in OTT only watch without kids presence.",positive
8,An exhilarating experience...,"This film is definitely not a family one, but thats what allows the director to fully portray his vision. It is violent but not as extreme as others are describing it. The 3hr 20min runtime flys by, this is the first film where I felt the longer runtime is justified. The story was emotional and extremely entertaining, the actor's performances are the best thing about this film. I already know that people will complain about some of the vulgarity however I think it was perfectly executed and necessary to the overarching story. I would definitely recommend this film, it is one of the most entertaining films to come out of Bollywood this year. Incase you didn't already know stay for the post credits scene, you won't regret it.",positive
1,Worst movie of the year,It's not just the misogynistic theme going on..the entire movie is trash. For starters even if they wanted to show some male showman with bold male characters casting ranbeer was an utter failure. He barely qualifies the profile.And the entire movie or storyline is the worst I have ever seen. It doesn't have a frame work or even a baseline story. Everything is just made to outline the concept of male dominance and Most of the time it doesn't make any sense at all. It is praised throughout the movie and what I cannot really understand is the pathetic cast of ranbeer as the epitome of male dominance.,negative

6,Family Vengeance Issue Portrayed through Quentin Tarantino style..,"*** Animal Hindi Movie Review ***Starring Ranbir Kapoor in the lead role. Also starring Rashmika Mandanna Bobby Deol & Anil S Kapoor .Directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga.One Line Review : Family Vengeance Issue Portrayed through Quentin Tarantino style..Ranbir Kapoor as an animal. An extremely violent version of Ranbir had been showcased here & he fits into these shoes well. Sandeep had taken out his extreme rage character & had made him toiled for this character which we were able to notice on the screen.Bobby Deol comes at the last 1 hour & his contribution had any impact. As his character was a mute person, his impact was too a mute. If it's conveyed in a way that its not always words but sometimes less words more action speaks as a defence mechanism, still Bobby Deol was under utilized.Anil Kapoor whose character is the soul and why this title suits Ranbir's character, had done a decent performance..Rashmika an Ok performance delivery.But the film which was rocketing high in the first half with a terrific interval block , 2nd half was down with over insertion of family drama, father - son bond, lust, last few hours of streched feel made the movie watching unbearable.Sandeep had taken a told known topic in a violent mode. So it's like a coconut appearing to be tough at out but when broken it's decayed..Still a 1 time Watchable flick.. 3 / 5 ⭐",negative
10,Vanga Delivered Violence and Drama,"It can't be denied that not everyone will love this film, and films like this one are meant to be that way by design. Vanga made a lot of bold choices, and the movie delivers plenty of violence with more drama than anyone could have anticipated. It is always fun to see a flawed character going all out and doing whatever it takes to achieve his goal. After all, this is why we watch movies, so that we can take a break from our ordinary lives.Ranbir has nailed this role, and this is his best performance till date, even better than Rockstar. Rashmika had her moment to shine, and she was amazing. There is no need to mention Anil Kapoor because he was obviously fantastic in his role.Maybe, they could have utilized Bobby better, but I get why they didn't. This film is all about Ranbir's character and his relationship with his father. So the focus is kept on him, and we get to explore his dark side for the most part of the film. Some scenes are very bold, and that is why they are so impactful.Overall, it is very impactful, and I recommend watching this in the theatres. Obviously, if you don't have a thick skin and don't like watching films where the characters aren't exactly ideals to be followed, you should stay away from this one.",positive

He knows how to extract the meat out of bone. I am so happy that Indian cinema has become a global celebration. Movies are at per of Hollywood movies. What to say about Animal. Ranbir Kapoor's best performance so far. It's a very complex and energy demand character to play. Anil Kapoor always shine like old wine. Rashmika has given her best performance till now. Bobby Deol was a cheer surprise to this band wagon. He is superb! Story is simple but the characters are very complex. Action is top notch for Indian movies. Redefining action with high adrenaline pump. This is movie is made to celebrate in Big Screen with a comfortable seat in the theater for this 3 and 1/2 hours movie.,positive
7,Brutal storytelling with convection!,"""Animal,"" Sandeep Reddy Vanga's third cinematic venture, delves into the affection of a young kid for his father, gradually reaching toxic levels. The first half of the movie lacks a linear storyline, while the second half adopts a straightforward approach to storytelling. The issue arises as the story seems simple and entertaining in the first half, but complexity arises in the second half, featuring scenes that feel like a break in continuity.This isn't an action movie; it's more of a drama where almost 90% of the content is dramatic. Every actor in the movie delivers a phenomenal performance. Some scenes, such as killing someone and engaging in a physical relationship suddenly with blood all over you, or dancing nude in public, are challenging to portray onscreen convincingly. The post-credit scene is also noteworthy, and I won't spoil it.Sandeep Reddy Vanga's cinematic framing is beautiful, and credit goes to the cinematography team. The background score serves as the heartbeat of the movie, flowing throughout and pleasing the audience. The only drawback in the technical aspect is the editing; some scenes, like the recovery scenes of Ranbir Kapoor's character, feel unnecessary.Certain characters are introduced but left unexplored, like the bodyguard beaten for being with Ranbir's character when he stood up against those who offended his sister. Despite Ranbir's character promising to remember him, the story forgets him. Shakti Kapoor's character remains unjustified throughout the movie.A significant complaint is the underutilization of Bobby Deol. He doesn't come across as an antagonist; although he looks villainous, his limited screen presence hampers audience connection. Despite a powerful backstory, his character is not explored enough, making this 3-hour-22-minute movie feel empty regarding his role.Despite these issues, I recommend this movie because Bollywood hasn't witnessed anything like this before. It takes courage to create such a film, and Sandeep Reddy Vanga executes it convincingly. Kudos to him. With the promise of a sequel, I hope the sequel will also maintain the same brutal honesty in storytelling.",positive
8,Not for the fainthearted!,"A Ranbir show through and through. He has outdone himself in his performance from all the other previous movies. Character creation of Sandeep Reddy is our inner demons on acid. Arjun Reddy felt like a newborn baby in comparison. Some other striking performances were from Saurabh Sachdeva (acting as Bobby Deol's brother) and Bobby Deol himself. Rashmika has tried her best( I guess) but felt overacting at many places. Anil Kapoor has done his part neatly , but don't fall for the father son bonding taglines. That's not what this is!!! Also this had some fresh action/Gore scenes which was sick. Not for the fainthearted!",positive
10,Mind-blowing and memorable,One of the best movies I have watched in a while. Sandeep Reddy Vanga is a true genius. He challenged status quo like never before. Ranbir and Anil Kapoor gave brilliant performances as well. I am certain that this film will have reconsolidated Ranbir's reputation in the industry as a star. A thorough entertainer and certainly his father's worthy son.Ultimately the secret of the success lay in the direction since it is the director who brings out the best in his actors and Sandeep Reddy Vanga has always been a champion in this field. Even minor characters like Prem Chopra and Tripti Dymrii were amazing in their limited screentime. Great way for Bobby Deol to make a comeback. The scenes and the realistic acting will always be memorable. The film certainly is a reality-check for many (as is evident for those who are unnecessarily unnerved by this masterpiece). Eagerly waiting for the sequel.,positive
1,If negative review is possible this one would be reviewed as -10,"Not even a movie, it's a visual torture of Gore, pain and bloody scenes which defies all the logic and sense.Show of Pomp and fake Machoistic showcase of so-called Alpha Male.A boy who is maddingly in love with his father despite having an iota of father-son affection in the whole movie.Avoid if you can, if you like to experiment with your senses, please go on and avoid watching with family if you guys are sensitive to sexual content and violence at large.Warning: If you value your sanity, avoid this film like the plague. It is not an exaggeration to say that subjecting yourself to this cinematic nightmare is akin to willingly inflicting self-torture. The explicit sexual content and gratuitous violence further amplify the discomfort, making it an unsuitable choice for family viewing, especially for those sensitive to such explicit material.In conclusion, this movie is an insult to the art of filmmaking, a shameful display of excess without substance. Spare yourself the agony, and steer clear of this disastrous attempt at entertainment.",negative
3,Adult rated but childish script,"The first half is watchable but second is unbearable, Ranbir only read half script it seems. The vison of director sunk the film , Bobby shines in limited screen time and Ranbir tries his best to carry this but the story is biggest let down and screen time is too lengthy and feels like a drag, didn't they had editors? Or they forget? Kabir Singh was a masterpiece while this is unbearable after interval...... avoid this film for the truma it will cause. Watch on ott .......... Ranbir deserved a better script, he is just unlucky to the talent he has..........his time will cm soon.................",negative
8,"Animal (2023): A Blood-Soaked Opera of Vengeance, Where Morality Gets Tangoed by Bullets","Sandeep Reddy Vanga's Animal isn't a movie, it's a three-hour adrenaline enema disguised as a gangster epic. It's a hyper-stylized ballet of vengeance, where violence pirouettes with operatic flair and morality gets tangoed by bullets under neon spotlights. Calling it entertaining is like saying the Grand Canyon is ""a neat ditch;"" it's an experience that pummels your senses, leaving you gasping for air and debating whether to call an ambulance or book a front-row seat for the encore.Ranbir Kapoor sheds his boyish charm like a cobra molting its skin to embody Jung Bahadur Singh, a man whose love for his gangster father curdles into molten rage after a betrayal that would make Shakespeare jealous. Kapoor is a revelation, his eyes smoldering with manic intensity, every move a predator calculating its next pounce. This isn't your typical hero's journey; Jung is an anti-hero dipped in acid, his righteousness as twisted as a pretzel dipped in cyanide.Vanga, who also wrote the story, crafts a narrative that's as labyrinthine as a Mobius strip lined with razor blades. Timelines fold and unfold like origami in a hurricane, past and present tangoing on a dance floor slick with betrayal. The story itself isn't exactly groundbreaking - family, betrayal, revenge, the usual mafia bingo - but it's the execution that makes Animal a disco ball in hell. Vanga paints his canvas with a lurid palette of violence, each action sequence a blood-soaked ballet choreographed by Tarantino on his angriest day. Bullets pirouette in slow-motion, arterial spray paints the screen in crimson, and every bone crack resonates with a sickening satisfaction that's oddly poetic.Yet, amidst the operatic carnage, Vanga throws in unexpected grace notes of tenderness. Jung's relationship with his mother (Rashmika Mandanna) is a heartbreaking counterpoint to his descent into darkness. Her quiet strength and unwavering love offer a glimpse of the man Jung might have been, had fate not dealt him a hand with more aces than a Vegas backroom. These moments, though fleeting, are like finding a rose blooming in a graveyard, offering a much-needed emotional breather before the next shotgun symphony.Animal is a sensory feast for the brave. Cinematographer Eero Saarinen bathes the Mumbai underworld in neon and smoke, creating a visually intoxicating atmosphere that's equal parts Scorsese and Lynch. The pulsating score by Amit Trivedi is the film's emotional heartbeat, driving the narrative forward with a rhythm that makes your pulse quicken and your feet tap, even as your brain screams ""danger zone!"" Every element, from the meticulously designed costumes that drip with gangster swagger to the visceral sound design that makes every bullet impact feel like a punch to the gut, works in concert to create a world that is both seductive and utterly unforgiving.However, Animal isn't for everyone. The unrelenting violence might feel like a Tarantino marathon on fast-forward for some, while the film's operatic tone and melodrama could make even Al Pacino raise an eyebrow. The narrative's complexity can be as tangled as a Mob accountant's spreadsheets, and the three-hour runtime might test the patience of viewers seeking a quick action fix.But for those willing to surrender to its audacious vision, Animal is a cinematic rollercoaster that leaves you feeling like you just rode a dragon made of pure adrenaline. It's a film that provokes discussion and challenges expectations. It's not perfect, but its flaws are mere brushstrokes on a canvas that pulsates with raw energy and emotional resonance. Vanga has crafted a film that is as unapologetically brutal as it is undeniably entertaining, a modern gangster epic that announces him as a filmmaker unafraid to push boundaries and leave audiences breathless, even if they're gasping for air through a mixture of awe and terror.So, strap in, grab your metaphorical bulletproof vest, and dive into the blood-soaked opera of Animal. Just be prepared to emerge shaken, stirred, and utterly enthralled by the savage beauty of this cinematic beast.",positive
5,Average Movie. Storyless Timepass Movie,"Some good aspects of the movie :-1. Ranbir Kapoor's dashing entry.2. Brilliant performance by Ranbir Kapoor
3. Young Ranbir Kapoor's classroom scene gives goosebumps.4. Action scenes, Goosebumps scenes, romance, suspense were all in the first hour of the movie. There was no boring scene.5. The action scene of the hotel is one of the highlight scenes of this movie
6. The movie before Interval is very good. There was no scene that was boring. There was entertainment.7. Entry of Bobby Deol two hours after the finale movie.8. The climax of the movie was somewhat emotional.Some bad aspects of the movie :-There is no story in this movie. This is the biggest problem with the movie.1. When did Ranbir Kapoor become a superstar?2. After the interval, the whole movie is slow. Movies are now completely boring.3. 2 hours and 40 minutes of the 3 hour movie went by and still I didn't see any story.4. Rashmika Mandanna did full on overacting throughout the movie.5. Bobby Deol's role in the movie is very small.6. The length of the movie is too long. A minimum of 30 to 40 minutes could have been cut.7. After the first half, the movie will definitely get boring.8. The movie songs are not that good. Also the background score is very bad.9. The movie contains some adult scenes. Because of which this movie is not a family movie.10. The movie wastes a lot of time due to its long length.",negative
1,Pathetic,"I waited for this movie to come on OTT and was glad I didn't waste my money watching it in theatre. I still regret wasting my time watching it though. Even if one ignores the pathetic portrayal of women, the third class dialogues which can only be heard in a jhopadpatti; there is no story. Such stupid illogical chain of events I didn't understand the whole point of the story. The editing is subpar, the dialogues are basic . Ranbir kapoor getting best actor award proves that if you shake your head in fine tremors to display anger then you are considered a great actor in bollywood.why are such movies making this much money in bollywood is beyond my understanding. Above all why did the bollywood actresses agreed to portray these roles? Kuch aatmasamman hai ya nahi?",negative
10,Blockbuster Movie Everyone Must Watch This Movie,"ANIMAL( Hindi /Indian movie )- My review:
TOTALLY ENGAGING and a crazy ride( As MB said, mental ekkuddi).I wish that this director will stay crazy ( SANKI gaadu itlaney vundaale). Story telling is just bloody fabulous. He has to be crazy to tell a story in this format .Ranbeer Kapoor blew my mind with his performance . AK brought all his experience and added the utmost importance with his acting nuances.All actors who played key roles are amazing.What I realized is that Sandeep Reddy vanga is taking us in to his crazy world and succeeding to engage us despite our usual comforts/discomforts.There are many things I wouldn't have usually appreciated but here I dare not to complain as he made them an integral part of the story and characters/ characterization.All songs are Beautiful.Back ground score is top notchAs the director said, don't miss the beginning and end.HEADS UP: This movie is rated A. I would write that in large red color A.So, NOT FOR KIDS and not for adults who are super sensitive to blood/gore and language.Be prepared for 4 hours of your time commitment including the break and ads etc.I did not feel bored or lag throughout the 3hr25 min run time.Lot more to write but I will stop here to let you guys go crazy in theater .",positive
10,Best,"One of the best acting performance ever
Wild action Wild controversies.A son undergoes a remarkable transformation as the bond with his father begins to fracture, and he becomes consumed by a quest for vengeance.This is one movie that leaves you speechless and spellbound! Sandeep Reddy Vanga brilliantly blends all the elements of a mass movie and makes it look like a cult classic! The movie is full of electrifying and explosive scenes that give you such adrenaline high that you won't mind sitting through some stretched out scenes which seem necessary to make us soak in the impact. The BGM is as much the hero of the movie as much as Ranbir's character is, the BGM builds up the excitement, captivates you and keeps up the intensity throughout the movie. I would recommend watching this in IMAX for an enthralling experience.",positive
10,No Spoiler And no blah blah info on acting lol,"Wrote this review just after watching, so movie is still fresh in mind, great movie not gonna lie.Started as complete extreme, action packed, thriller ( Action and Thriller, is not for gun or fist fights, its just the vibe it gave, you will see that its not as action packed as one might have imagined from teaser, Actually trailer gave a better outlook on movie, as thats what it really is, A family, Psychological Drama with lots of emotions and love- you will feel it too later on, if you are correct audience for it. And this movie didn't shy away from blood and fight, which i loved ),Then converted into Psychological, Family Issues ( you already guessed it from trailer i think ), A unique outlook and ways of doing things ( This can't be seen in trailer, only in movie ).By the end, got very emotional ( i enjoyed that part the most, as it left a deep impact on me, so acting was top notch and emotions was right on track as it gets me ), and as always ended with complete twist ( You can only see movie for it lol ).So hands down, this was a wild ride and a great ride for me. ( At least at the moment of writing this review, i am full of emotions about the movie lol )",positive
8,Sandeep Reddy Vanga is India's Quentin Tarantino !!,"This Animal takes you on a wild beast-mode ride with gritty action sequences and a father-son drama. Ranbir again proves why he is one of the finest Indian actors in the current gen. He gives his best. The other hero of this movie is BGM. Many action sequences get the necessary elevation due to amazing score by Harshavardhan. Rashmika plays her part well and her confrontation scenes with Ranbir stand out. Sandeep pens some really good practical dialogues for all those scenes. Never seen Bobby Deol act so well. He brings life to the antagonist role just with his expressions. Overall, this Animal is something that has never been tamed on Indian screen. Although, it's 3 hr plus, you won't regret watching something different on the screen. Go for it !!As far as Sandeep, Arjun Reddy still stands out as his best work till date. But Animal is no less.",positive
8,A Son's Unconditional Love,"The Animal Movie is an action-packed film that showcases the extreme levels of a son's love for his father. The cinematography in this movie is excellent, capturing the thrilling action sequences with precision. The dialogues are well-written and add depth to the characters' emotions. However, some of Ranbir Kapoor's dialogues can be considered sexist and do not reflect real-life scenarios. These dialogues could have been avoided to create a more inclusive and respectful narrative.The acting in this film is top-notch, with standout performances from Ranbir Kapoor, Anil Kapoor, and Bobby Deol. Bobby Deol's comeback to the screen is remarkable, and he delivers a great performance. The chemistry between the actors is evident, adding to the overall appeal of the movie.The action sequences are superbly choreographed, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. The music in the film, especially the songs ""Saare Dunya Jala Dengy"" and ""Papa Meri Jaan,"" contributes to the overall impact of the movie.However, one drawback of the Animal Movie is its lengthy runtime of around 3 hours and 25 minutes, which can feel dragged at times. Some songs could have been omitted to maintain a better pace. Additionally, Rashmika's acting is poor and lacks emotion, and her dialogues come off as cringy.Despite these minor flaws, the Animal Movie is a captivating film that explores the depth of a father-son relationship. It reminds us that not every child is typical and highlights the consequences of neglect. Overall, the Animal Movie is a must-watch for its outstanding cinematography, excellent dialogues, and great acting performances.",positive
9,CINEMA!,"Ranbir Kapoor's animal is full fledged Cinema. For all the cinema lovers, this is the prime time of Hindi cinema. Phenomenal performance by every individual in the film. Be it Tripti dimri, Bobby Deol, Anil kapoor, Shakti kapoor, rashmika or ranbir, everyone was extra ordinary in the film. Sandeep Reddy wanga has clearly shown how film is made. Story telling was fantastic. The cuts somewhere felt too sharp and crisp which affected next scenes. Cinematography could have been a little more better. Bgm music and all the songs are very much interesting and people just jump out of their sits when arjan velley and that scenes plays. Color Oder of the film is wonderful and looks of Ranbir Kapoor helps the audience to navigate the time and space of the scenes. There were some moments where it feels scenes are too prolonged but those were very few. Rashmika's dialogue delivery somewhere was a problem but it can be ignored in front of her performance. Overall this film has actually helped audience to open mind keys and view at larger spectrum of art.",positive
1,Scenes with top notch BGM giving you short lasting adrenaline rush affecting your personality.,"Dear Sandeep Reddy Vanga,
Movies have a huge influence on the people especially in Asian countries like India and Pakistan. Movies need to have a positive message in 'em. What message did you give to the people who watched your Animal movie?You are making scenes with top notch BGM which give audience a short lasting adrenaline rush but in the long run, in the future, they have a negative effect on their personality.We asian people grow up watching the movies and calling the protagonist in a movie as HERO and copy their actions and behaviours in real life. In your movie Animal , you have portrayed the protagonist as a person having following features:
1. Toxic Masculinity
2. Sleeping with other women while he is married.3. Normalising smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol in a movie and make him look cool while he does it.4. Has no respect for the religion.And many other things that skipped.my mind right now.Such type of movies should not be indian born because indians are the people with civility and decency.",negative

Great direction.The songs ,the background music everything was awesome. But this is not meant for all audience. Lots of violence is here in this movie.I am mesmerized by Ranbir's acting. I think no other actor can perform like this in this role.After Shahrukh Khan I think he is the next king of Bollywood. He got the all the talent to become a superstar. He is superstar now, but he will be the top king of Bollywood.Director has done a great job. The making of the movie is awesome. Great editing, great making.Superb movie.",positive
1,Disappointing Experience - Save Your Money!,"I just blew 520 bucks on the latest so-called ""animal"" movie, and let me tell you, it's an absolute disaster. These Bollywood idiots never fail to disappoint. I keep telling myself not to waste money on their crap, but here I am, regretting every penny spent.Ranveer Kapoor was trying his best, but what the hell was that excuse for a story? Seriously, do these filmmakers even know what a story is? I'm talking to you, Bollywood - make a movie, but don't insult us with this garbage.The trailer was a bait-and-switch, the beginning was a joke, and after the interval, it felt like I was enduring a cinematic hemorrhoid. What a waste of time and money!I won't be fooled into watching another one of your pathetic attempts at moviemaking. Save your hard-earned cash and steer clear of this cinematic disaster. Bollywood, you need a reality check, and fast.Angry and Disgusted,",negative
1,DISGUSTING!!,Bollywood is achieving a new level of low every time. Seeing that this even got released i think raj Kundra just did not get the time right else he would actually be successful. What was even the point of this movie are we now giving validation to the psychopaths that are out their who mostly end up jailed that they have a meaning. And the other hand we are saying that the culture that we had was s**t that is the kind of feeling I got from this movie and with this you can see they are progressing towards any publicity is good publicity & I am pretty sure that they will get that only from this 1 star review and they are of the same breed as raj kundra but don't say it outwardly. I am really happy that i did not pay a dime to watch this when it released but i thing is quite clear that Bollywood is becoming a industry serving the shameless. Any movies that are released portray the values of the lace it is released from and I am pretty sure this was not the value of India that put us on the map. Although i do agree the brotherhood and fearlessness we should have in front of an enemy but this was not that. Another thing that it depicts is that being indifferent to a growing child makes him someone who should never be born. The movie was only good till he went down in the first fight after that it became something that should never have been released.,negative
10,A Riveting Tale of Vengeance and Transformation,"In the high-octane world of Indian cinema, ""Animal"" emerges as a formidable force, a 2023 action thriller directed and edited by the talented Sandeep Reddy Vanga. This cinematic rollercoaster is produced by a powerhouse ensemble of Bhushan Kumar, Krishan Kumar, Murad Khetani, and Pranay Reddy Vanga, showcasing the combined might of T-Series Films, Bhadrakali Pictures, and Cine1 Studios.The film's star-studded cast includes the charismatic Ranbir Kapoor, the evergreen Anil Kapoor, the versatile Bobby Deol, the captivating Rashmika Mandanna, and the talented Tripti Dimri. At its core, ""Animal"" explores the dynamics of family, vengeance, and transformation.The narrative thrust of the movie is established from the very first scene, immediately gripping the audience's attention. While it revolves around a revenge-driven storyline, it manages to infuse fresh energy and tension into this familiar trope. The screenplay keeps viewers on the edge of their seats, never letting go of the taunt grip it establishes early on.The film boasts exceptional performances from its lead cast, with each artist breathing life into their characters. Bobby Deol, in particular, shines brilliantly without uttering a single word, a testament to his acting prowess.Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga must be commended for his remarkable vision and execution. His ability to craft a narrative that maintains its intensity throughout is truly commendable. The background score and songs seamlessly complement the storytelling, enhancing the overall experience.While ""Animal"" excels in many aspects, some dialogues, especially those delivered by Ranbir Kapoor's character, may come across as slightly melodramatic. However, this might well be a deliberate choice by the director to underline the character's mental state.In conclusion, ""Animal"" is a must-watch for enthusiasts of action and thriller genres. It offers a captivating and gripping storyline, outstanding performances, and skillful direction. It's a cinematic experience that delves into the complexities of human relationships, revenge, and transformation, leaving the audience with much to contemplate long after the credits roll.",positive

Delve into the camera work, lighting, photography, and framing, evaluating how these elements enhance or detract from the movie's overall impact. Consider how the cinematography supports the film's themes and emotions. The director is the creative force behind a film, responsible for shaping its vision and execution. Analyze the director's choices, considering their impact on the film's storytelling, pacing, and overall atmosphere. Reflect on the director's previous work, if applicable, and how this film fits into their role.",positive
1,Trash Trash Trash,"This film is truly unpleasant. It's filled with violence, lacks any coherent storyline, and is simply too gory. It strays far from reality and fails to engage with a compelling narrative. Indian movies should refrain from portraying the main character as a hero solely based on the actor's fame. Additionally, the dated portrayal of women perpetuates harmful stereotypes, showcasing a lack of sensitivity in storytelling. The film's shortcomings highlight a need for a more thoughtful approach in both narrative construction and societal representation. Regrettably, three hours of my time wasted. It's evident they aim to create a sequel for this disappointing content Hopefully, others won't be deceived again.",negative
10,Terrific character study of a troubled character. Animal is cinema.,"Can someone explain how is Ram saying ""meri mardangi ke baare mein gaon ki kisi bhi ladki se puchh lo, report achhi milegi"" in Ram Leela not misogynistic? How is Shahid Kapoor's womanizer character Javed in Teri Meri Kahaani not misogynistic?They are portrayed as alpha males. They just don't say it out loud because they aren't sociopaths or criminals or murderers. So just because these characters are in a love story, perpetuating a thought process that sleeping with multiple women is an achievement and glorifying it is not problematic or promoting toxic masculinity at all. Got it.Apparently, the Indian masses who are going to cinemas to watch 'A' rated Animal are all incels which means audience of Jawan and Animal are mutually exclusive. Saying that audience of Animal is chhapri means that chhapris who never watched Pathaan and Jawan were especially born to watch Animal.Imagine getting triggered by Animal when you spent your entire college life binge watching American tv shows like Breaking Bad, Game Of Thrones, and recommending them to your college friends. Who was watching Breaking Bad and rooting against Walter White?Were Ram Gopal Verma, Allu Arjun, Baradwaj Rangan, Jimmy Cage paid money to praise the film? Are Tripti Dimri, Rashmika Mandanna, Ridhi Dogra and all the women who either worked in the film or defend the film, misogynists?Ranvijay is a criminal, not a doctor. If police catches a murderer and ask why, he will give his reason. That does not justify murder. It is HIS pov. Ranvijay said that to win the argument and shut her up. We don't have to agree with how a fictional character thinks.Animal is a tale of two halves. At intermission, it feels like the movie ended which is why the 2nd half feels like a sequel to the 1st half.The first 20 minutes are very important to understand the psyche of Ranvijay. That's the hook. Once you understand what kind of a character he is, nothing he says or does in the rest of the film should come as a surprise. Aziz is the only true surprise who turns out to be an insane psychopath which makes Ranvijay seem like the lesser evil. He needs to have the last word. He justifies every single thing where a normal person would have chosen to remain silent. He has the answer to every remark, every question thrown against him. Ranvijay is a million miles away from a average guy like Kabir Singh or Arjun Reddy. He is a sociopath with violent tendencies and comes from the richest Indian family and fires a gun in his sister's school. There is 0 relatability with this guy.Ranbir Kapoor is one of the greatest Indian actors as Animal further proves. None of the characters are supposed to be worshipped or celebrated. It explores the psyche of a criminal who deals in extremes. It is absolutely a character study. Not sure how average Indian males can even relate to such an arrogant, troubled, obsessed, violent character. If that is the case, they are the problem. Not the film. And it's not like Ranvijay has achieved anything significant by the end of the film. He lost. His father will die and his wife left him. But during the narration, as a viewer, ofcourse you can cheer for him whether it is for killing his sister's husband, fighting Abrar, using the machine gun or for something else because A. You know the context. B. You have understood his psyche within the first 20 minutes and you understand how he justifies his actions. But nobody told you to emulate him after coming out of the cinema hall because you are not him so you can't use his justifications to commit crimes. In Pulp Fiction, Jules recites Bible before killing Brett as if it justifies it but it is never criticized. Looking forward to Animal Park.",positive
1,This movie is a superhit.... R you SERIOUS!!!,"The movie animal is nothing what was shown in the trailer. Totally mislead the public by portraying the movie as father son drama. Don't be fooled by the trailer of the movie. This movie doesn't have any story and is very pathetic.Honestly I did like the first half where I felt the movie was doing ok. But as it progressed, it became worse and worse. There was no proper storyline and everything seemed completely disconnected. Ranbir's acting was only the highlight of the movie. The movie has earned so much only because of misleading people like me (And they call it a super hit- WOW)Overall pathetic, boring, waste of time and money. Surely Bollywood can make better films and cast better people. The downfall of Bollywood movies is unbelievable!!!",negative
1,Has bollywood died.....,"Bollywood has always delivered movies which are so far away from reality that you cant expect to take it seriously. I have always treated a lot of them as a means of escapism and entertainment. There are some good examples out there and they have a start, middle and end you can follow coherently.Unfortunately this is not one of them....the first 10 mins had me intrigued and then it all went sliding into a black pit of whats going on here, the movie definitely provokes a response and I can understand why its done so well at the box office, due to its excessive vulgarity and violence, people inherently don't get this in bollywood or the subcontinent from A list actors.So watch it at your peril, because aside from that, you arent getting anything else.",negative

Absolutely irresponsible film-making. I'm glad the film has an A raring and would be very pleased if no OTT showcases it on their platform. No reputable actors should ever want to work with this director who seems to be a habitual offender and takes pride in his crass narratives against women.If Kabir Singh's character made you choke, Vijay Balbir Singh will give you a stroke!There is no redeeming factor for the movie or for the people portraying the various characters in the film.Give it a miss!",negative

Don't see the bad reviews they are paid I have seen the whole movie pure ""Paisa wasool"" but one thing don't try to copy Ranbir Kapoor from the movie in real life.",positive

A must-watch for those craving a dose of high-octane drama with a distinctly Bollywood flair.",positive
10,Really an Animal,"A must watch Movie, from direction to acting, superb job done. Very strong emontions involved. This movie will be Mega Hit and with this Ranbir has emerged as the roaring Lion in the industry and many records will be broken.Do not miss the opportunity to watch in the cinemas to enjoy the Animal experience..I always thought no one can come close to how Yash oozes power and charisma in KGF but Ranbir outshines all superstars in this role by showcasing different looks from youth to old age with such perfection, once again showing what a phenomenal actor he is. While there are super stars who can make a movie work just from looks, dialogues and style, Ranbir is an acting powerhouse and the scenes he is in, you just cannot take your eyes off himThis is one of the few movies you can watch more than once as there is so much to absorb in almost every scene, you end up missing some aspects! My eyes fixated on Ranbir - totally smitten with the way he emotes just with his eyes, perfection in overall look at different stages of life, his natural subtle dialogue delivery and my ears on music, will need one or two times more to process other aspects!",positive
9,Close to Masterpiece,"Everything is phenomenal about the movie but in a scene, they showed cheating too much that it destroys the logic. The way they showed the romance in the first half the cheating feels really really bad. Although, it was a part of a plan, it could have been minimised. That would have reduced the length. There was a scene where I felt they could have used the song more than dialogues. Overall if these film would have removed or change the scenes mentioned above and showed bobby more it would been a lot better. Overall, it could have been a masterpiece.Tips: Don't watch if you are a feminist. Don't watch with your parents.",positive
9,Awesome movie with violent scenes,"Awesome movie. Good background music. Ranbir acred so well. All characters acted in full capacity. Ranbir proved that he is extremely talented nepo kid. Though he proved in every movie like Rockstar, Sanju but this movie is extreme. Every emotion whether romantic, anger, emotion, guilt he acted so well.But there are some voilence which is extreme. Its hard to sleep for me after watching this movie. This movie is not for soft hearted poeple. Also it glorifies smoking, killing ,anger. Every killing scene is extreme brutal. Pyco killers and minds can easily follow what is shown. Ranbir should give clarification on smoking scene and tells poeple not to smoke. Otherwise new generation always follows bollywood actors.",positive
9,A Milestone in Hindi Action Dramas,"Animal is a completely unexpected movie.....This is a completely fresh and new take on action dramas. Animal is not a normal movie.....it is completely crazy.It is one of the most violent movies that I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot). It is so violent that it is breaking new groundIt is 2-3 movies in one. Long but gripping from its first scene to its last. Every frame of the movie is utilized from its first second to the final second of its credit scene is part of the story.The action scenes, stunts, fights with the background music and songs are close to perfection. The action is so over the top but somehow realistic that it is mind boggling.....Think......a much more brutal, action packed and emotionally charged John Wick in a Dhoti + moreRanbir Kapoor - This is his best performance of all time. It is complex, nuanced, funny, scary and completely unhinged. This is not the chocolate face coming of age Ranbir.....he has completely mutated into something elseBobby Deol - Absolutely no words and no comments on his performance and role. Best left to be watched on screenWord of caution - Animal is not everyone's cup of tea. It will leave you gasping for air especially if you cant tolerate the sight of blood. Curse words are abundant. Dont expect to see the Ranbir of all his previous movies.....He is angry and you may not like him when he is angry.I was fully captivated by the movie and completely blown away by its pace, its story, its characters, the acting, the background music, the action, the songs....but don't take my word for it as I may be experiencing post traumatic shock. I just realized that it is also very addictive.....I am going to watch it again tomorrow. 9/10Action Cinema has changed today.",positive
6,"Animal: A Gripping Tale of Action, Acting, and Audience Hypocrisy","""Animal"" delves into the realms of toxic masculinity with a bold and unapologetic narrative, presenting a glaring contrast to the hypocrisy of contemporary audiences. It's intriguing to observe the dichotomy in viewer reactions, as those who applaud the dark and gritty themes in ""Game of Thrones,"" ""Sacred Games,"" and ""Gangs of Wasseypur"" seem to waver when confronted with similar content in this film. This disparity highlights the selective sensitivities and contradictions in how audiences perceive challenging themes. The film's action sequences are a testament to its cinematic excellence. Crafted with precision and intensity, they provide a visceral and exhilarating experience that elevates the movie's overall impact. Complementing these high-octane scenes is the exceptional acting. Ranbir and Bobby deliver captivating and nuanced performances, adding depth and complexity to their characters. Anil Kapoor, too, makes a significant mark with his compelling portrayal, enriching the film's narrative fabric. An additional layer to the movie's immersive experience is its memorable background music. The soundtrack adeptly enhances the emotional depth and tension of scenes, weaving together the film's thematic and aesthetic elements. However, ""Animal"" is not without its flaws. The storyline, while engaging at the outset, becomes stretched and loses momentum, particularly in the second half. This pacing issue detracts from the film's initial promise, leaving a feeling of unfulfilled potential. Overall, ""Animal"" stands as a powerful cinematic piece, notable for its action, acting, and music. Yet, it's also a reflective mirror to the audience, challenging their perceptions and attitudes towards dark themes. While it shines in many aspects, its narrative pacing prevents it from being a completely cohesive and satisfying experience.",negative
1,3.5 hours of my life I'll never get back,"The only animal in this movie are the makers of the movie who didn't have the intelligence of humans. It was as if five different people imagined some of the scenes that were supposed to be in the movie then an entirely different person wrote the story stitching together those scenes over a tea break. Watch a paint dry instead of this abomination.Forget people who are talking about misogyny and political statements, I mean there are better reasons not to watch this movie and the reason is that it makes no sense whatsoever. Ten years old write better stories than this. Action scene sucks, characters have no development, villains are introduced and killed every five minutes, heck even some characters have no roles in the plot at all.",negative
10,"Whole movie is all around war between cousins and how they follow their faith, lifestyle as they both belongs to different koms","I saw the reviews and understood, many Indians couldn't understand the theme of the movie: This story is all about how lifestyle and thinking changes after the religious conversation and to finish zombies around you, definitely you have to be an animal and there is no alternate way to it. So much similar to the current situation in Israel and India. So this is the 1st Bollywood movie which got a 10 star rating from myself. In between you may feel boring because of excessive bloodshed, romance bla bla bla but once upon a time it was very common in whole world. So don't defame this movie because of that. After all this is everyday routine of zombies.",positive
2,This has gone beyond Marvel movies in making no sense,"It would have been a brilliant plot in a world without law enforcement, neither in India, nor in UK, nowhere.Jokes aside, Ranbir Kapoor and Anil Kapoor acting is good, rest all bad. Rashmika Mandana dialogues are not even clear at many points. Tripti Dimri is wasted for skin show nothing more than that.Bobby Deol is totally wasted with hardly any role to play.Looks like the entire family is violent and everybody is doing so well with this bloody nature.Sandeep Reddy Vanga sure knows how to make money with sh***y movies, create hype, present misogyny and violence, with loud dialogues, but no plot.The way he created the hype of extra screen time on netflix and then released the theatrical version.",negative
1,"No logic, no law and order","I can't imagine how the same Indian audience that appreciated pushpa,KGF etc could digest or welcome such a stupidity. This doesn't have either proper story or screenplay to appreciate. Neither there is any consistency in any character. If RRR elevated Indian cinema, this degraded it at all levels. Dude Sandeep, stop making films. You are no Tarantino or Hitchcock. You are just another RGV (he atleast did good movies when he was sensible). You can earn and become a billionaire. But, you will for sure destroy the narrative for Indian cinema. If this is your real character, then you need some help. Basically your generation directors haven't seen life. All you have seen is the ugly side of life and think that is the life..",negative
9,The Alpha Male monotony,"This movie has a potential of RK's most controversial one. There is no basis for character's toxic relationship with his father which is basically the core point of the film.But overall, our Director shows us what a violence is. Film is going to be massive hit no doubt as RK nailed the role he was given.But I was hoping character gets some consequences of his doings in the end but they actually planning a multiverse I guess.Bobby Deol's acting was short but on point. Rashmika's role is as important as Preeti's in Kabir Singh.I just hope current genz generation watch it for perspective only and not get inspired by the toxic behaviour of main character.",positive
4,Toxicity on steroids!!,"I'm not big on hating creative pursuits because I realize thay every piece of creativity has a lot of effort involved in the background, as was the case here I'm sure.But I can't not talk about how laughable it was to see them romanticize so many toxic ideas and the idea of a man-baby basically! They did try to redeem this by talking about the reasoning for it and his own childhood traumas towards the end, but by that time, I was so frustrated that I could not even wrap my mind around what the point of this entire movie/creative pursuit was to begin with!??Was it trying to say something? Are they trying to share a message? Are they trying to discuss a social issue? Or is it just a mix of anything that is polarizing for the crowd and they have jumbled it all up together with lots of violence and action to make it more controversial Just for the sake of being controversial. I'm sure if the last thing was their goal then they definitely succeeded.But as far as creative pursuits go, I think this was truly a failure!! I really hope actors as good as Ranbir Kapoor, abstain from involving themselves in abhorrent and silly creative pursuits like this!!",negative
10,Animal is animal,"I have been seeing all kind of negative reviews for this film, but for the most part movie live upto the expectations. Nicely shot film, sandeep is not afraid to do something hard hitting. Watch it, your day will be hard with lot of emotions and high impact performances, overall well cast. New wave in Indian film started with KGF, now animal sets bar high. Simple story with high dose drama. Director previous film Kabir sing has shadow similarities, bit more violent. I wish movie has reduced its length to 3hr below to avoid few unnecessary scenes. Cinematography, Background score, casting and art work is splendid.",positive
10,Ranbir is just badass,"What an amazing movie. I was itching to watch this.I loved the fact that Sikhs were finally shown some respect in Bollywood.The storyline is well written. Ranbir kapoor suited this role. The action scenes were ace.The story itself was decent.Only thing I felt let it down was the sexual references and sex scenes which they really didn't need to add into the movie that did spoil it. The songs were decent especially Arjun vailey which went perfect with the fight scene.Bobby deol don't know why they bothered with him
In it.The film is a must watch and possibly one the best Bollywood movies this year.",positive
1,"A insult to cinema, Cinematic Assault on Senses and Sanity","This movie offers a painful cinematic experience, marred by consistent disruptions in its flow, a lack of cohesive storyline, and a collection of cringe-worthy dialogues that even B-grade movies would find hard to match. The film suffers from jarring transitions between scenes, leaving viewers struggling to connect the dots and maintain engagement.The dialogues, described as uncatchy and resembling those of a B-grade production, contribute to the overall disappointment. With no memorable lines to salvage the viewing experience, the audience is left with a sense of disconnect from the characters and the narrative.The unnecessary and unrealistic fight scenes further diminish the film's appeal. Rather than enhancing the plot, these action sequences come across as forced attempts by the director to showcase their prowess, ultimately detracting from the movie's overall coherence.It's evident that the director lacks a discerning eye for scene selection, as viewers find themselves disoriented within every five minutes of the film. This lack of timing and cohesion hampers any potential connection with the storyline or characters.Comparing Animal unfavorably to ""Brahmastra"" speaks volumes about its quality. Even though the latter is criticized, the former manages to fall even further below the mark. Both films share the unfortunate distinction of earning a one-star rating, as Animal fails to deliver on even the most basic expectations. This Bollywood misstep stands as a contender for the worst movie of the decade, leaving audiences yearning for a more satisfying cinematic experience.",negative
8,TOTALLY ENGAGING and A CRAZY RIDE,"The most Terrific, Intense ,Mind Blowing and Insanely intense film of 2023. The only hiccup is the length of the film. Apart from that, performances by ranbir kapoor, anil kapoor, bobby deol -- their best till date. First half of the movie is on another level altogether, just mind blowing, even second half is great but felt stretched having said that if you don't let the director take that time, the superb climax wouldn't have been that impactful.Go to cinemas, immerse yourself in this intense father-son drama..

Intense drama, powerful performances, simple storyline, great direction. They way Vamga moulded the characters and

And BOBBY DEOL AURA IS DAMN PEAKED 20 mins of his role and you are mesmerised by it he made the comback of a lifetime well deserved and kept in the movie movie could have been short by 20 mins or so but cant complain.

10,"That hand-gesture at the post-credits spells out a new term, Vangaism.","The cry-babies are testament that their bubble has been broken. Vanga has hollered sixes over their heads in almost all directions. Gutsy, brutal and absolutely unhinged, this one is not for the high-priests of morality, and definitely not for activists. Ranbir Kapoor has delivered in what is probably his career-best. Anil Kapoor is brilliant as well. It was a pleasure to find Bobby Deol in such a deliciously evil avatar, probably for the first time in his career. The story leaves you eager for more, which is up next, in Animal Park.The songs, particularly ""Satranga"" are very good.There are a lot of political subtexts which have ruffled feathers in a lot of birds. Just that they can't bring 'em up, that's why the 'vidhwa-vilaap' regarding misogyny and blah blah blah.That hand-gesture at the post-credits spells out a new term, Vangaism. The hand-gesture also indicates exactly how important critics and feminists are to Vanga.And to us.Run to the theatre, NOW, and experience the insanity.",positive
7,Full on violence only for RK fans,A movie about a son's (RK) love for his father (AK) and to what extreme he goes to destroy and execute those who want to harm his father! The movies focus is on RK who nailed his role perfectly as the animal he becomes on the road of revenge! Anil Kapoor played his role well. Rashmika's role wasn't special could have been played by any actress the rest of the cast were good. Bobby Deol's extended cameo ( only came at the end part of the movie) was pure swagger mixed with rage should have used more time on his character. Overall first half was epic but slows down after the interval the movie could have been shorter but if u like RK and love brutal loud action scenes then go watch it! *Not one for the family (very violent and has repetitive pointless kissing scenes and partial nudity) 7.5/10 👍🏽,positive
9,What a Movie Man. Fantastic.,"I was amazed by Ranbir's performance. No one can come near to what a devil role he can play. Even Rashmika was at her best. Story is superb. Only issue I found was Ranbir asking character Zoya to lick his foot, which may be justifying his character but will not go down well with female audience. Direction is superb. He has a unique style of representing events which will surprise you. So many goosebump moments will be there. And he will teach his sisters not to fall in love with any loafer but to select life partner after checking his credentials properly. A must watch film. Waiting for Animal Park release. Faadu movie hai boss.",positive
10,A Ferociously Entertaining Masterclass in Action Cinema,"Animal is not just a film, it's an amazing experience that grabs you by the throat and refuses to let go. Ranbir Kapoor delivers the performance of his career as a man consumed by rage and driven by primal instincts, he emerges from his comfort zone to unleash a raw and unhinged performance in animal, a film that pushes the boundaries of action cinema with its brutal violence, breathtaking visuals, and a story that will stay with you long after the credits roll.The action sequences are brutal and balletic. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with Anil Kapoor and Bobby Deol providing stellar support. The film is brutal, emotional, and ultimately, deeply human. Sandeep Reddy Vanga's masterful direction keeps you on the edge of your seat. But it's the sheer audacity of the film, its willingness to push boundaries and challenge expectations, that truly sets Animal apart.While its runtime may be a little bit longer and some people who bemoan ""Animal's"" runtime fail to understand that true cinema requires space to unfurl its wings, but trust me guys, it is precisely within its extended canvas that Vanga allows the narrative to breathe, the characters to develop, and the emotions to resonate and I've seen no one moving out of their seats until the movie ends. It is a film that demands your full attention, rewarding you with a powerful and unforgettable experience that lingers long after the final scene fades.And most importantly this is not a film for the faint of heart, but for those who appreciate a truly original and powerful cinematic experience.Animal is a must-watch.",positive
10,Mind-blowing,"This movie is blockbuster start to finish Ranbir Kapoor just outshines in every department. I think Ranbir career will change after this.i feel he is the upcoming superstar of Indian cinema.guys please don't miss the last 5 minutes wait untill movie completely finished.Last 5 minutes will blow your mind . Alsorashmika, Anil Kapoor , Bobby deol were just outstanding and played their part well.but Ranbir hits the 6 and outshines all of them.Specially the vision of sandip vanga Reddy will blow your mind

What a story... what a screenplay... what editing.... what background music.

1,Most rubbish movie,"This is the most rubbish movie I ever seen . But ofcourse Indian audiance will love this type of movie because they are not capable of better thinking. This movie is just about firing guns and cheating and toxicity. Very much disappointed for Ranbir Kapoor , he is such a good actor but this storyline is the worst. Indian audiance will never learn to verify a good movie even after death of sushant singh rajput. I don't blame the actor or actress because the Indian audience love to watch this type of movie that's why puspa,kgf like movie is super hit movie.

Probably this is the reason why people have made attempt to decrease the rating of this movie. Watch it as its worth it.Coming to movie, a strong flavour of our culture and a bond and respect of a son to his father what a common lad in India would feel. The ""Baap pe mat jana"" feeling which is trademark of every Indian guy is the heart and soul of this movie.Ranbir has justified with the character offered and so does others.

7,Recommended 👍🏼 by Hit Ya Flop - Movie World,"Animal is a rare cinematic exploration delving into the intricate tapestry of human emotions and relationships. However, the storyline may not resonate with all moviegoers and the use of gore in movie can be divisive among audiences. Still, the director Sandeep Reddy Vanga ensured that the audience's interest was maintained throughout the entirety of the movie. The film is marked by impressive performances from its cast and the cinematography employed in the movie is noteworthy, contributing to the overall visual appeal. The storytelling is so well-crafted that boredom becomes a rarity, as each scene contributes meaningfully to the plot development. It will keep the viewers glued to their seats throughout its extensive runtime of 3 hours and 21 minutes.The first half sets the stage for a compelling viewing experience. During this initial portion, the film manages to engage viewers through a combination of gripping storytelling and well-executed action scenes. The narrative unfolds smoothly, capturing the audience's attention and building anticipation for what is to come. As the film progresses into its second half, the momentum established in the first part is maintained, albeit at a slightly different pace. The songs and background score play a crucial role in establishing the tone and intensity of various sequences throughout the movie.Ranbir Kapoor has delivered an outstanding performance that stands out as one of his best works to date. His portrayal adds depth and authenticity to the character, leaving a lasting impact on the audience. Bobby Deol, despite having a limited role, manages to impress the audience with his performance, leaving viewers eager to see more of him in action. Rashmika Mandanna was decent and Anil Kapoor also delivered a good performance, showcasing his seasoned acting skills and adding value to the ensemble. Tripti Dimri, Shakti Kapoor, Charu Shankar, and other supporting actor's collective efforts contribute to the effectiveness of the ensemble, ensuring that each character, regardless of the screen time, adds to the overall impact of ""Animal."".Direction 4/5

1,Just one word for Sandeep Reddy Vanga - SHAME!!,"""Animal"" movie left me utterly disgusted with its abhorrent treatment of women and terrible script.The portrayal of Sikhs too is not just disappointing; it's downright offensive. The movie script is a stain on the industry's commitment to responsible storytelling. It's disheartening to witness incredibly talented actors neglecting their power to influence perceptions and choosing to bring this misguided script to life. Falls far short of what the audience deserves from the industry's best actors.Creative freedom should never be an excuse for promoting regressive narratives or perpetuating stereotypes that harm communities. A regrettable choice to watch this movie.",negative

All actors did great job. Sandeep Reddy vanga has proved that kabir Singh was no fluke.he is an intelligent director Somehow he managed to keep audience to their toes throughout. Even its 3 hours and 23 minutes i was not bored for a second. Just have one problem that Bobby deol should've gotten more time. Still i can say that it's Definitely worth watching....

10,SING PRAISE TO THE KING OF JUNGLE,"Sandeep Reddy Vanga is the new 🐐 of the film making. To make a three and half hour long movie with familiar plot lines and without a brilliant story to back that up, and yet come out triumphant tells that movie does have other elements that make audience whistle.The first flourish of background Music, Larger than life and as primal as Bollywood has seen its protagonist be persona, over the top dialogues and elaborate well choreographed fight scenes with an odd ( and brilliant choice ) singing in the background... It had almost everything that could be considered as the secondary featur s of a great film and each one of those done almost brilliantly.Movie never claimed to be a masterpiece either in telling an intricate story or a brilliant piece of drama or complex thriller. It came with an ""A"" certification which in this case is no Censor board error and a director's name who is considered a misogynist and spread alpha male egoism.The movie lived up to all its hype of being huge and then added that VIKRAMesque climax ending to a well done story of father son bond and an Alpha male's interpretation of right, wrong, ethics and morality of today's society.No main character are there to just warm the screen, and that 10 minute plot between Rashmika and Ranbir in second half is the testimony of how to write all your major characters. Bobby wins heart in his small yet impactful role.And then comes the B. Praak with his voice to life the climax beyond 7 sky. I am not exaggerating when I say that it had more impact (or similar if humbly put) to that of Mann Bharya in Sheshah.THIS IS NOT A CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE. But if Indian cinema needed a RRR, it also needed an ANIMAL. And nobody else could have done it better than SRV. Take a bow.",positive
10,Well Made With Some Wrong choice But Good Content,"There Two reasons to get So Much Hype first one is Sandeep Reddy vanga and how Sandeep shows Ranbir.

Ranbir is terrific, Anil and Bobby definitely needs mention, both actress are good, Sandeep Did brilliant job in all aspects but he wanted to show some scenes to audience whether they like it or not.

9,This will divide the audiences.,"If you are reactive to sensitive topics, stay clear. Try and appreciate the art and direction of the film. This isn't just for Bollywood. This is for cinema. This is for the broken noses, scars, wounds, hearts and dreams. Sometimes your favourite genre film lies within you. This is one of those moments. You either like it or you don't. You either get it or you don't.Violence, love, comedy, obsession, family, heartbreak and toxicity - mish mashed together resulting in an explosion leaving chaotic debris or beautiful art. You choose. The reviews and critics will be split. The script is untidy but done with great skill. This is a traditional and relatable family saga that touches on father and son relationships. It touches on mental health and childhood trauma, which are often taboo topics in South Asian families. The film has heart, as does the soundtrack.Ranbir owned the role and covered various stages of the character's life superbly. Every actor in Bollywood (and perhaps beyond) will need to have a look at themselves in the mirror and ask themselves if they want to continue in this game after seeing this.Anil - a class and sleek father role.Rashmika - a star is born. A strong performance against a towering Rambir.Bobby - no words. Literally.Shakti Kapoor, Prem Chopra and Suresh Oberoi - legendary cameos.Criticisms:Vanga clearly had a lot of fun with this - almost like a fanboy. He threw everything in the mixer and therefore sometimes hard to keep up with some plot holes (although he edited and cut alot). It felt like there was homage to Tarantino, a bit of Godfather (directly quoted) and Bollywood classics - some times less is more. The Muslims in film felt a bit misplaced and misrepresented (as did other groups). And finally Triptii - super talented actress with clean resumé (all her films worth a watch), but underused and oddly inserted role in my view - some will beg to differ due to the link to the events to come.",positive
1,Endless Discomfort: 3.5 Hours of Cinematic Despair,"The film glorifies mindless violence, coupled with inappropriate humour(if I can even call it humour), and Rashmika's lifeless acting only worsens the experience.I endured the entire movie, hoping for improvement, but my day was ultimately wasted. Unsure how anyone signs up for such movies, sending wrong messages to our generation. Hope this genre fades; discouraging its production is crucial.Bollywood must raise its standards. Casting big stars without a substantial story should be a myth, not reality..Take my advice and save yourself from the trauma the movie gives you.RIP Bollywood.",negative
1,Pathetic movie so far with no story and just violence,Most pathetic movie I have seen. The movie violence is too much and there is no story. Such a shame to watch a disgusting movie like this where women are shown weaker asked to lick the shoes and given no respect. Violence to its highest peak. Nuidity for no reason. In my whole life I never rated any movie but this movie is most pathetic. Its not at all entertaining just love for dad makes him do all non sense things like murder many people and cheat with wife and much more. The acting of Ranbir is good but the story is too bad and lengthy for no reason. Action scene is only 1 or 2 rest all violence.,negative
4,I am not triggered. That was just a BAD movie,"I am not someone who don't like gore. In fact, I don't even blink while watching gore - Saw franchise, Final Destination franchise, Hostel, Friday the 13th, you name it and I have seen it. It is a movie scene and as long as it is required, why not! But Animal, my god, the ""fight"" scenes were overdrawn and stretched so far, for the heck of it and nothing at all. When I heard the insane length of the movie, I was excited. I said to myself ""Woah, a director who is not afraid to keep the length of the movie to truly justify the movie's plot"" but watching it that was not it at all. You could have cut 50% of the movie and not only would have it not made any difference to overall plot (not at all), on the contrary it would have made the movie crispier and I should not have to fight myself from feeling asleep.Cast wise, everyone was wasted except for Ranbir, who did average. I don't think he was about to pull it off in a way I had hoped to, after seeing the nuances he provided in the film Tamasha. Just growing your beard and hair and smoking and killing doesn't capture the essence of the role: I constantly wondered what Ranger Singh and Shahid Kapoor could have done for that role and I am a big Ranbir fan. Anil Kapoor had nothing much to do but whatever he was given, he did okay - but the worst part about his character was not his screen time, but the inconsistency with his character development. They didn't justify why he acted so authoritative in 10 percent of the movie and 90 percent he was like a lost child waiting to be guided. And the most glaring part, Ranbir and he had no father-son category. Bobby Deol, the character I was most excited about - but god oh god, was he wasted. And I don't mean because of his screen time. A compelling character can shine in just few minutes, even seconds. He was just there for a shock value for few seconds. I think the most interesting character and the one who stole the movie was the women lead. She had few things she could really shine on but her screen presence was powerful enough she shone even when she was suppose to be an observer. Don't even get me started on the unrealistic parts of the movies.There are revolutionary directors who are not afraid to push the envelope and risk triggering or even getting backlash for the sake of art because some art does need it. And there's the second kind, who pretend so hard to be the aforementioned type but is clearly not. This director seems to fall on the latter category. And isn't it convenient to blame the audience not liking the movie based on bold scenes!The vulgar jokes didn't piss me off because it was vulgar, it pissed me off that it was put in so many places simply because it is vulgar!The 2 stars is the for the woman lead and the 2 stars is for the first 30 minutes.",negative
1,My biggest problem is not the stupidity,"The movie is glorifying Violence and Misogyny. People who need validation for using guns and thinking they are an ""Alpha"" will get it from this movie. Ranbir Kapoor is truly playing a violent animal but the problem is that the world we are trying to build a civilized society.I regret watching this movie and giving it any money at all. A way to help impressionable children who will inevitably end up watching this garbage and to help the misguided people think this is the right way to live, I urge you to not watch it. Do not become even a tiny part of the success of this movie. I went unaware. You have a choice.",negative
1,"Horrible, Sheer Waste of Time","The movie is a total waste of our valuable 3 hours, as it contains neither a meaningful story, nor fun or entertainment, nor makes any sense. Absolutely unrelatable in today's generation when everyone, young or old, male or female is so mature & progressive. In short, this movie contributes 0%, not even as an entertainer, keep logic at bay. God knows how it earned this huge sum of money, by deceiving people with it's TRP, or the box office collection is actually fake. However, not waiting for it's sequel at all please, thanks to the makers for this torture already, it's no more wanted as a sequel or something.",negative
1,Bad taste! Shame on Ranbir Kapoor and T-Series,"Ranbir Kapoor, Kapoor Family and T-Series should be ashamed of doing this so called blockbuster movie, yes the makers made money out of this Animal, so Congratulations 👏 but they would know internally they made a cringe movie that would hurt some sections, specially women...literally shameful act by T-Series. The directors and actors have a role in shaping up future India, and this film doesn't help.Though the film is A rated, many young kids are watching it as Govt has no proper regulations or control over the screening. It appears Sandeep Reddy needs some mental counseling. Can Rajamouli help?Glad that the movie turned out to be a flop in South states TN, Karnataka and Kerala, proving the maturity levels of audience in these states.",negative
2,Waste of time,"Bad Acting, Bad Screenplay, Bad Plot Like nothing even holds this movie to be notable . I don't get why people love it or even like it to begin with. You can portray violence all you want but even the violence here is forgettable. People praising it for violence clearly hasn't seen any violent films. Unnecessary bad dialogues just to make it appear appetizing for little kids. I knew this movie was going to be bad as soon as I heard the protagonist talk about being ""alpha"" in the first 20 minutes. And It all went downhill after the 1st hour(Doesn't mean the 1st hour was good though). Total Waste of everything. This Film neither offers a good screenplay nor a good acting total nothing. Pure emptiness Didn't even feel anything watching this. There was not even a single scene that could grab my attention. Pathetic Film making. This is not what cinema is meant to be.",negative
1,Worst movie,"Bad influence on the society. The writer and director Sandeep Reddy Vanga ( Kabir Singh )......by just showing bloodshed everywhere, blurred nude scene, angry eyes, hard hitting background music.....you just cannot portray animalistic human
Childhood not being happy and not much care and love received from parents, well, you have picked up the psychological factor correctly for Ranbir's mental state, but as a viewer one will not feel the connection with the actor.Animal proves to be a colossal disappointment that leaves audiences questioning the sanity of its creators lots of critics are giving paid five star or four star reviews do not believe them this movie is nothing but a sob begging for the attention from his billionaire father.",negative
1,Waste of time,The story of the movie is pathetic. No one knows in which direction the movie is going. Only stupid action fight which makes no sense at all. I can't name the cast but some of them has acted terribly. Unnecessarily dialogues which makes no sense to the audience. A complete waste of 3 hr 21 min. I recommend everyone to rather spend time with their loved ones. I was a big fan of RK but now I understood why he is not getting blockbusters. Only smoking has been shown in the whole movie. RK please don't select such kind of story which makes no sense. Your fans must be hurt after watching this movie.,negative
9,Best movie of 2023,"Ranbir had already warned that sensitive and people who get triggered should stay away, yet they went and watched and giving negative ratings. Cinema is to express and instigate emotions and there were no rules set for this. I am more of a fan of Vanga's personality than his movie making skills because he is badass and didn't give a F about critics and audience and post covid made a 3.21hrs long movie with a conviction which deserves all the appreciation. To me Animal was best movie of 2023, it is one of the most unique Indian movie. Only thing I didn't like about the movie was some scenes were not required. Otherwise, it is such an entertaining movie and definitely has a rewatch value. Over the years definitely this movie will get a cult status.",positive
10,This is what a man and son should be,"This is by far the very best role of Ranbir Kapoor; he has forged here an unforgettable character that will go down in the annals of Indian films. His searing portrayal of a fearless, loyal, dedicated son who loves his father above all else in the world is something to behold. He is a force of nature, unstoppable, against all odds, a flame burning so bright it seems destined to burn itself alive. The arc of redemption of a fractured father-son relationship is a hard road, and the lucky few reconcile before death comes calling.Rashmika Mandanna plays the devoted wife, swept away by the sheer power and flame of the Alpha male Vijay, helpless to resist his fiery vision of the world. The immortal evergreen Anil Kapoor plays the fatherly counterpoint, the nexus and purpose of Vijay's life.The action scenes are mind-blowing and satisfying, and you can see the flamboyant touch of the Tollywood director. Humour is used wisely and provides much relief between tense scenes.I was particularly impressed by the fierce indomitable loyalty of Vijay's cousins from the village - any man with such blood defenders can consider himself a king.3 and a half hours went by breathlessly, this was epic filmmaking, modern yet traditional, humble yet arrogant, reverent yet taboo. This is what a man and son should be.",positive
1,Strong disappointment,"It is a horrible movie and has several elements that shows immorality out of the context. What surprises me is how can someone convince so many actors and great people from the past to sign up for something so terrible. This is a big time low for Bollywood and I'm sad to witness it. If you are reading this, I sincerely request you to not watch it. It has all sort of misconduct in a glorified form that is extremely disturbing to watch and consume. I strongly condemn all the actors who were a part of this movie. If I were to undo my watch time, I'd have really take my time back. This is also an effort to bring down the unbelievably high 6 rating to hopefully 1 someday. \m/",negative
8,"Though entertaining, yet very toxic masculinity","Extremely toxic masculinity! But as a movie, it's highly entertaining n very wild. Probably one of the violent movie mostly carved in blood that I have seen which is centred around relationship between a father n a son. There's definitely no law n order in movie. The first half keeps completely hooked n engaged n then gets a little dragged. That climax n preface set for next sequence movie is just stunning. And what was that huge gun machine at the interval? Oops! A crazy movie! This movie for sure set the stardom of Ranbir Kapoor very high. Everybody acted very well. Available in all languages in Netflix. My ratings 8/10!",positive
10,Excellent movie,"There are some movies which stays in our memory till the eternity. This is one such movie, very brave concept and outstanding acting by all. It showcases many underlying truth and reality from our society, which is quite often shove under the carpet as male chauvinism but never understood properly. The build up of the story in the movie, direction, cinematography, background score and least to say the acting has been perfect. Bobby Deol's bollywood career has been reincarnated with his superb screen presence in this movie and this has to be one of the best movie of Ranbir Kapoor. It's time to look beyond the Khan's now and their over hyped projects. I must say Bollywood missed such movies for a long period but it's back with a bang. ANIMAL is a must watch movie.",positive
10,Action and performance - a masterpiece,"Not sure why some idiots are talking about story and plots when there are many Hollywood counterparts and western movies that are just brilliant due to its lead cast performance and the way movie unfolds.Movie could have been shortened.ONE word - once in an era a performance comes out from the lead that stamps on your heart . Remember Agnipath ? Ranbir mind blowing performance in rockstar, where he transformed from fun-loving to a love fanatic ....none other can make that happen ...This movie has him playing to demonstrate psychotic love for his dad. U-mazingly acted. You can feel the craze the emotion through his eyes/glare and just him standing on the screen ...",positive
10,Animal best movie,"Watch the entire film. It's important to watch the whole movie before writing your review, so you have the necessary information to write a thorough, thoughtful piece. If possible, watch the film more than once, taking notes on different aspects, like acting, cinematography, music, theme, and narrative arcs. Upon repeat viewings, new information may come to your attention that influences your opinion, and an epic movie it was. Ranbir and Bobby mass bro psych go watch the film. As December draws to a close, there's no doubt that ""Animal"" has clinched the title of the best movie of 2023. The anticipation was sky-high, fueled by the intriguing trailer that promised a powerful Father and Son bond. However, a word of caution to those planning a family outing - this movie is not for the faint-hearted, with its abundance of bold scenes that might catch you off guard.",positive
1,Ranbir takes a huge dump,As a foreigner watching this film was like multiple pins going in my eyes I could not even look at the screen for long time because of horrendous violence. In a time where three countries are at severe War we need more stories revolving around love and peace and not perpetuating violence anger killing and romanticizing and individuals such as the lead character.They tried to do a lot with adding many kissing scenes which absolutely were cringeworthy with the other actress sex scenes are dull and boring and non-stop wishes violence it's just pathetic I'm not sure how people are liking this film it is the same old story of ranbir kapoor and his character is always having issues with his father and his family blah blah blah blah blah do they not have any new Concepts or ideas and honestly why did Bobby even do this film?,negative
1,Tasteless and Tone deaf,"I do not write reviews for movies, like ever. But watching this movie for so disheartening that I had to do this.The movie is so devoid of a moral compass. While Arjun Reddy had a similar theme, it had some lines it did not cross. Glorifying gun violence in schools !?? SERIOUSLY !!Let me just say this.. it was a bad movie which was made badly. Not much thought to what the central theme was, no consistency to the characters and to top it all off the movie was an excellent example of bad movie making.. the editing, direction and character development were all over the place.Avoid at all costs.",negative
2,Action packed direction less emotional drama,"1. The movie has no cohesive storyline.2. Movie is extra ordinarily extended, duration is 3.15 hours
3. Too much of violence and unnecessary action.4. The acting is really good if you like overstressed emotional violence.5. The thought process should not be applied to this movie, a depressed derogation of female image.6. Action is not natural, sequences mixed from John Wick, KGF 1 and 2, Marriage scene is inspired from Godfather. But that too not creatively copied.7. You can see a glimpse of Thor's belly with same costume and make up as that of Avenger end game.8. Villain and hero have same bodies and same bears styles.9. The plane scenes and mafia style is copied from 365 movie series (available on Netflix)
10. Father who is loved most in the storyline has no opinion or control over his son, that itself breaks the cruz of the story.Watch at your own risk, disturbing violence.",negative
9,"Falling for Ranveer even more , but love is srk","Everything is beyond perfection, I loved it , only thing I don't like is Rasmika , apart from her everything is mass, emotional, importantly the way vanga shows the bond between father & son is so damn emotional & it melt from bottom of my heart,
Also it's so damn good when he formed his own trust worthy boys clud (if u watched then movie then u know wwhat I'm talking about) to prevent anything worse than before.After one more thing is that when those mens came to kill him & his Bros are stating that song to build up his moral and confidence, that was great 👍👍👍👍,
The only thing I'm rateing 9 out of 10 is bcz of Rashmika , nothing else.",positive
1,Cinematic CALAMITY,"In my attempt to watch this movie on NETFLIX today, I found myself unable to endure it, resulting in profound disillusionment and a considerable waste of time. The film emerges as an epitome of misogyny and patriarchy, marked by the use of phrases like 'man's world.' Without a doubt, it stands as a cinematic calamity, and those proclaiming it as a blockbuster require genuine therapeutic intervention. The pervasive tone of the movie is not just disheartening for humans but, ironically, even animals would likely be dismayed by a film bearing their name. The fervent desire to expunge it from my memory underscores the lasting impact of this regrettable viewing experience.",negative
1,An overhyped mess,"This movie is like a stinky garbage bin, you try to cover up the smell with some strong air freshener but we all know that it doesn't work. It feels like a movie that had everything but good plot and some brain cells. I can confidently say that within 10 years we will be making fun of this move. Kabir Singh was a far superior movie as it's story was well structured ignoring the problematic aspects. The Father-Son relationship in this movie was so superfacial, It could be explored more and developed more. Now let's talk about how illogical this movie was, you are killing people like insects, you slaughtered a person in front of a crowd and there is no consequence!!!!no aftermath!!!! No inquiry !!! In real world it doesn't happen. They could at least show that how they are managing the police and press and when it comes to action, some action scenes were totally over the top, unrealistic mess. Violence for the sake of violence, just a short term adrenaline rush that's it. Villains were not well development, felt pretty flat, one dimensional. The music was okay. The only good thing about this movie is Ranbir's and Anil's acting but only acting can not carry a movie with a bad storyline. Remove the violence and poor sexual jokes it will come to the same level as Race 3 as a movie. Violence+Gore+Race 3+K3G= congratulations Animal is born. People who are comparing it with Tarantino's works for them I will say you don't understand movies,and history sorry. Gangs of Wasseypur is a far more violent movie than Animal but everything seemed legit and logical but Animal falls apart when it comes to logic and presentation. And when it comes about misogyny, it totally depends on how you perceive it. If the problematic scenes boost your ego, tickle the sigma male in you then the problem is deep seeded within you.",negative
1,"I was a Ranbir Kapoor fan, not anymore.","I am surprised why an actor who did timeless classics like Wake up Sid, Rocket Singh, Tamasha, Barfi kind of movies did a senseless movie like animal. Amir Khan is right about the violence part. I like action movies too but in this movie it's over the top.There are a lot of fathers in this country who are always busy with the work. It doesn't justify the reckless behavior of the son. Thankfully mothers shape their sons well and create responsible human beings.Last but not the least they have portrayed women as helpless, pawns in the society of men. This is not progressive cinema it's a piece of entertainment which spreads negativity.If you like watching senseless violence, and if your definition of masculinity is a guy with a gun then go and watch this movie.",negative
6,A visceral tale of vengeance with ferocious acting and flaws,"Animal claws its way through the screen, a relentless onslaught of violence and passion fueled by Ranbir Kapoor's electrifying performance as Ranvijay Singh Balbir. Ranvijay, a man whose love for his father burns with both devotion and desperation, finds himself embroiled in a web of vengeance after an attack on Balbir Singh (Anil Kapoor).Kapoor embodies Ranvijay's wildness with a ferocity that's both captivating and unsettling. He sheds his usual charm, transforming into a creature driven by primal instincts and an unwavering loyalty that borders on obsession. This is a career-defining performance, demanding a raw vulnerability and intense rage that Kapoor delivers with unsettling brilliance.The first half of Animal is a whirlwind of action and intrigue. The character introductions, the expertly choreographed action sequences, and the escalating tension kept me on the edge of my seat. The interval sequence explodes with energy, propelled by Harshavardhan Rameshwar's powerful score, leaving you breathless and eager for more.Rashmika Mandanna shines as Geethanjali, Ranvijay's love interest, balancing innocence with a quiet strength that grounds him. Their on-screen chemistry is undeniable, making their tumultuous relationship even more impactful. However, the second half takes a turn into darker territory, exploring the psychological depths of Ranvijay's character. This shift may not resonate with all viewers, especially those looking for a straightforward action-thriller.The film grapples with themes of family, loyalty, and the destructive nature of unchecked rage. While the exploration of these complexities is commendable, the tonal shifts can feel jarring, potentially alienating some audience members. However, the technical aspects remain consistently impressive. The cinematography captures the gritty underbelly of the city, the action sequences are brutal and balletic, and the music adds layers of emotional depth.Animal is a bold and audacious film, demanding its viewers to confront its raw emotions and unflinching violence. Kapoor's powerhouse performance anchors the film, while the first half delivers gripping action and suspense. However, the tonal shifts and psychological exploration in the second half may not appeal to everyone. Ultimately, Animal is a film for those who crave an intense and unconventional experience, one that will leave them exhilarated, disturbed, and deeply reflective.",negative
10,"CULT MOVIE , THE BEST CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE","I have watched this great piece of art 4 times in the movie hall. The mobie never leaves a dull moment , engaging storyline and one of the best cinematic experiences. Ranbir Kapoor is on fire and the intensity on his face speaks volumes in each and every scene of the movie. Undoubtedly the best actor in the country. Amazing music. Best action sequences and the gangster vibe is simply outstanding. The linkage of the story with Punjab and the cousins bond with Ranbir is simply incredible. Songs like Arjan Vailly brings the motivation and energy to the highest level and the action exhibited in this song is supreme.",positive
1,Worst Bollywood movie everrr,"This is the worst Bollywood movie ever. I wasted 4 hours watching this movie. It glorified school shootings, women abuse, cheating and much more. The team should be ashamed of themselves for making such a trash movie. The story was dragged and missing parts.The actions scenes were bad, likely tried to copy South Indian movie action scenes.DO NO WATCH WITJ YOUR FAMILY - too many awkward sex scenes and kissing.One bright part was Bobby Deol's terrific acting as a villain.Once again, the worst movie I have ever watched.Please don't waste your money or time watching this piece of trash movie.",negative
1,This movie is CANCER !! Worst movie of the year !!,"This is a misogynistic movie where the protagonist dominates and beats up his wife , kills people , gets into extra marital affairs , doesn't take care of his children. Cheap directors who don't have any skill make these kind of movies just to earn money . Animal movie has an adverse impact on the society . Horrible movie !! It teaches violence and exacerbates misogynistic attitude .It is shocking to see Ranbir Kapoor who has done movies like Wake Up Sid , Barfi , Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani, is now doing this kind of horrible movies .Such movies can negatively impact the mindset of unaware people in the society .",negative
2,A pisspoor display of bravado.,A pisspoor display of bravado that simply justifies the cliches we are all so acquainted with. A movie that scrambles to find any path in its story. No amount of acting is going to save a story written by a 16 years old adolescent boy hitting puberty for the first time. And why Bollywood tries so hard to cast old AF men as Late 20s-early 30s characters?If they would only spend as much money in writing the story and script than in casting old dudes as post-pubescent protagonists.It's a hilarious movie in a very bad way. The antagonist is non-existent. Feels like all other characters have no significant impact on the story whats-so-ever.,negative
8,The most polarizing Indian movie of 2023,"This is a very controversial movie. Can be easily said as the most polarizing Indian movie of 2023. Some find it misogynistic while others find it liberating.Firstly, two things that are outstanding about the movie are the actors' performance and the Music. Sandeep can be lauded for the fact that he brings the best out of his cast. And he does have a unique style which needs to be appreciated, even though it's not to everyone's taste.But the movie can be easily made a superhit spoof of, if not for the BGM. I was neutral for the most part, which is not a compliment for the movie. But it did elicit feelings of hate during the scenes leading upto the big husband-wife fight scene. Watching Sandeep Reddy Vanga's films makes me feel like he's living through his protagonists lives that he wished to. Not sure if the gore was necessary, but as a woman, can't relate to it. And overall it seemed like he was trying to create an Indian John Wick-esque franchise. So clearly the target audience are men more than women.My takeaway motivation from the movie's story is the pure love of the protagonist and how far an internal fire, stemming from the pure love, can push you.",positive
4,Almost pulled my hair watching it,"With all the hype built around this movie, this is a huge let down. It felt good only in parts and rest of the movie didn't make any sense. Till interval the movie was still watchable, but the 2nd half was absolutely unbearable. It took an absolute miraculous performance by Ranbir that made me sit through it. I don't know why people rate Vanga so high. I couldn't bear 30 mins through Kabir singh, and had it not been Ranbir, i couldn't have watched this one either. I will never understand how movies like Jawan, Gadar 2 & Animal made more than 500cr at Indian box office. Jawan was the worst of the three, a pure cringe fest.",negative
5,Ranbir Kapoor's Stellar Performance Elevates Flawed Narrative: A Masterclass in Acting,"While the narrative, screenplay, and instances of unnecessary violence might fall short in the film, Ranbir Kapoor's performance emerges as an undeniable highlight, breathing life into the character with unparalleled skill and finesse. His acting prowess not only compensates for the plot's shortcomings but also elevates the overall viewing experience to a commendable level.In a cinematic landscape where a compelling performance can salvage a storyline, Kapoor's acting serves as a saving grace. The immersive quality of his portrayal manages to engage the audience, allowing them to overlook the deficiencies in the screenplay.Moreover, as the narrative flaws are set aside, it's essential to applaud the film's musical score. The music not only complements Kapoor's stellar performance but also becomes a character in its own right, enhancing the emotional impact of key scenes. The soundtrack, with its evocative melodies and well-crafted compositions, weaves seamlessly into the fabric of the film, adding an extra layer of depth to the overall cinematic experience.The synergy between Kapoor's acting and the musical elements creates a harmonious blend, enriching the storytelling and allowing the audience to connect with the characters on a visceral level. The emotional resonance achieved through the music serves as a bridge, compensating for any narrative gaps and offering a more immersive viewing journey.Despite the narrative's shortcomings, the film becomes a testament to the transformative power of exceptional acting and a compelling musical score.",negative
2,"GORE, BLOODSHED & LOTS OF MISOGYNY","1st half was okayish. But the 2nd half was utterly nonsense. Come on its 2023 still these kind of movies are being made . Like seriously !! The movie is just a 3 hrs long saga of bloodshed, gore, violence, vulgarity & a lots of misogyny. Film was supposed to show some kind of deep emotion between the father & the son. But it failed to show any emotional connection to that part also. Lots of unnecessary vulgar scenes & nasty dialogues were there.Only few things which I liked were the BGM & the songs. Felt good cinematic experience in very few scenes too.Overall, its a very bad & trashy movie. PLEASE DO NOT GO TO WATCH THE MOVIE WITH YOUR FAMILY its a request if anyone is very inclined to watch it.",negative
8,A masterpiece conceived in a bloody abattoir.,"Animal review :In an interview to certain ""elite"" critic after Kabir Singh's (2019) success, director Sandeep Reddy Vanga had condescendingly requested to not hurry to review his movies. He also warned the critic that he would show ""what violence is"" in his next movie. Well with Animal, Vanga has definitely delivered his promise of violence and made a seemingly critic proof movie as those one or two star reviews don't matter anymore. The film was housefull in a generally empty Sunday morning show at Citylight Cinema, Matunga!!Indeed, Animal is a masterpiece (with its share of flaws) conceived and executed in a bloody abattoir. It is as impactful as that axe crashing the head of Ranbir's opponent. You may like it, hate it but you just can't ignore this movie. Surely!!The basic theme of a neglected son (Ranbir Kapoor) going to any length for his father (Anil Kapoor) bears resemblance to the Sanjay Dutt- Kabir Bedi track in Feroz Khan's not-so-successful Yalgaar (1992). But Vanga chooses to take a different route of highly sadistic violence and blatant male chauvinism. In one scene, Ranbir's character praises his girlfriend (Rashmika Mandanna) pelvis and states she will bear him good children. Ouch!!Expectedly, Vanga extracts outstanding performances from his prime cast. Ranbir Kapoor is extraordinary and his life trajectory, from a school kiddo firing bullets in his sister's classroom to an oldie telling a monkey joke over a glass of whiskey, is simply superb. The actor is truly a delight to watch in every scene!!Anil Kapoor is reliably first rate as the father who finds a criminal in his doting son. Having said that, the reason why he neglects his son right since childhood remains unexplored. Tripti Dimri leaves an impact even in a small role. She has also exposed a lot in that sex scene with Ranbir. Bobby Deol gets just three pivotal scenes and nails it. His mute villain speaks volumes through his fiery eyes. Take a bow, Lord Bobby!! Rashmika Mandanna isn't as bad as the trolling she got after the trailer release. Her role though a main heroine, isn't developed optimally!!On the flipside, the three hours thirty minutes runtime (with interval) gets a bit overbearing as the film's tempo dips at several places in the second half. Vanga's self indulgence leads to certain long drawn scenes particularly the Ranbir-Rashmika verbal duel during Karva Chauth and that entire village sequence where Ranbir goes to recruit his fighter team.Finally, Animal relies heavily on its violence. The blood splurting action sequences are never seen before in Bollywood. You will need nerves of steel to stomach it. The pre-interval carnage in a hotel will leave you flabbergasted. Ditto for the bloodied climax in an airfield!! And in case you feel you have seen it all, please wait for the end credits sequence. The bloodbath ain't over yet in Vanga's world. Theres an Animal Park coming!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.",positive
3,"If not for Ranbir's acting and a few catchy tones, it's rating would've been in negative","I've seen people saying ""why can't we just let cinema be cinema"", or that ""people go to theatre for few hours of escape, so why don't just let them watch and enjoy?"", or ""don't take movies too seriously, just watch it and move on"".But that's where i get stuck, and I'm talking for many people here. Watching something for 3.5 hours, with all audio and visual effects to enhance your emotions... After this you couldn't just move on and completely be unaffected by what you just saw, or not let it impact you any way.This is especially if you enjoyed some of those 3.5 hours too.You always take a part of something you like with you, consciously or not.Now, this could absolutely be an amazing case study to depict the problems with patriarchy, toxic power, violence, anger issues, lack of self control and rational judgement.But obviously, most people really do go to the theatres for few hours of enjoyment and wouldn't care to put so much of mental energy into filtering good and bad parts of a movie or character, learning the good and consciously leaving out the bad.But not doing so would create a scenario in their brain where the negative traits of a character are almost acceptable, or even ""aplha"". Especially for easily influenced people, like school children or even many adults, it becomes a ""cool"" persona. For people with already the same mentality, it becomes another way to justify themselves.This is drastic for the society, unless viewers realise that along with the action and comedy that they just enjoyed, there were some deeply flawed traits that were glorified.",negative
1,Senseless Movie,Only adult scene and violence. No story. Director is directionless and mindless. I don.t recommend to watch that movie as it only time wasting. I don't know who write that story but please join some other profession so you newer waste other time. Director need to join some type of comedy circus so he can provide some good content. As this movie actions are pointless and certainly a bunch of jokes copied from Hollywood's movies The movie story is so boring and only adult scenes are there so you can be motivated with movie. Absolutory disgusting movie. All the rating given for this movie is paid.,negative
6,Entertaining. The suggestion of a sequel was ridiculous.,"This movie was long. 3h24minutes runtime. Yet, it was interesting and entertaining. There were plenty of plot holes. This is just a mindless entertainer, escapism entertainment. Its violent and gory. Certainly not family entertainment. The last few minutes were completely absurd suggesting a ridiculous sequel. This just spoiled what would have been a very satisfying ending. I hope this sequel is never made, it would just spoil what on its own would have been an excellent entertainer. There was no need to end with this suggestion of a sequel it just spoiled the movie completely. I would have rated this 8 otherwise.",negative
10,Must Watch,"The movie is a masterpiece, action packed with all the ingredients of a superhit. Loved it. Must watch. Ranbir is outstanding, Bobby deol hits the ball out of the park. The action packed movie leaves you glued to your seats. The music is exceptional. Anil kapoor doesn't age. I hope they make part two. The people who complain about length and feminism don't understand the true value of good cinema. I am watching it again it's a bargain. Movies like this are not made again and again. The storyline is intense direction outstanding and screenplay beautifully done. It doesn't hurt any sentiments. It's pure class!",positive
10,Perfect match with the title.,"I think this movie was quite good. I don't know it was also-a copy paste story or not. But the movie was good enough. Bollywood was already stopped producing good movies. As per present condition, i think this movie is mind blowing.People will say different word, but i think this movie is better than jawan. And the character of the ranvier Kapoor was totally insane.Yeah there was some awkward, scene. But overall the movie was best. Mainly it is a family rivalry. And as per the ending, we can guess that 2nd part will also come. One disappointing thing was, build up for ending was not enough. The villain got too little screen time.Still overall this movie was best enough as per the Bollywood certain condition.",positive

One of the best performance of Ranbir kapoor.Overall great movie, first half can be watched more than twice.Sandeep Reddy has done so much research on sikh community I was mind blown, the casting and editing was par excellent👍, this movie will break Khan's, 5 years of commitment will Defenetly result in box office collection.Sandeep has joined the league of elite directors.",positive
1,"Lacking Plot, extreme violence, misogynistic and sadistic","Despite its innumerable flaws the first half is still watchable for 18+ audience only. Editing left a lot to be desired, some scenes like underwear texture, rehabilitation of the protagonist and added love interest were totally un necessary.Plot is supposed to be a father son relationship but barring 30 min of the 3 hrs 22 min timeline, everything is all about the escapade of the ""Animal"" who is misogynistic, sadist, obsessed with reproductive organs and its clothing.Many of the dialogues and scenes are cringe but surprisingly evoked hooting and cheering from the audience which was shocking to me. Normalizing an extremely negative behavior to the point of glorifying is downright degradation of societal names when we are so obsessed with religious principles and values.Without revealing too much, all I can say is this movie is all showmanship, Ranbeer's performance and background score. Better save time and money and wait for the OTT release.",negative
2,Ranbir *** Bobby ** Story */2 Music***,"Two stars for Ranbir Looks, his manly act, music .... Rest is bakwas ... No story...emotions die after 3 hrs of gruesome scenes, too much fictional...that the story between dad n son doesn't gives ny connect. Very lengthy...that gives waste of time feel at the end. Kabir Singh atleast gv some thrilled feeling of passionate love... though this movie tried to match that kind of feel with its music ...it failed completely. To watch Ranbir / Bobby Deol, might be the shows r going ON so far 😂 ... There is no zinc! Wait for its OTT launch if you haven't book the show yet! Patience would be worth ...",negative

1,"of the animals , by the animals , for the animals.","In the realm of cinema, the delicate balance between art and entertainment is often challenged, and unfortunately, the film ""Chaos Unleashed"" spectacularly misses the mark. This supposed cinematic experience appears to revel in the glorification of violence while simultaneously forsaking any semblance of a coherent and engaging storyline, leaving audiences with a baffling and unsettling narrative.From the opening scenes, it becomes painfully evident that ""Chaos Unleashed"" prioritizes shock value over substance. The film's gratuitous depictions of violence, marked by over-the-top action sequences and an unsettling obsession with gore, feel more like a desperate attempt to grab attention rather than a thoughtful exploration of the human condition or societal issues. The relentless onslaught of brutality serves as a distraction, leaving audiences numb rather than engaged.What exacerbates the film's flaws is its inexplicable decision to stretch scenes without contributing to the overall narrative arc. Lengthy sequences devoid of meaningful dialogue or character development leave viewers grappling with a sense of frustration and boredom. It becomes a tiresome exercise to endure these prolonged moments, wondering if the director was merely indulging in an attempt to compensate for the lack of substance. Central to the film's disturbing nature is the portrayal of a psychopathic character as the hero. This narrative choice raises serious ethical concerns, as it blurs the line between right and wrong, effectively sending the wrong message to the audience. Instead of fostering empathy or moral reflection, ""Chaos Unleashed"" risks glorifying antisocial behavior, contributing to a narrative landscape that normalizes violence without consequences.What exacerbates the film's flaws is its inexplicable decision to stretch scenes without contributing to the overall narrative arc.

9,Now this is called a real movie,"I stopped watching indian movies since the early 2000s because it was the same old nonsense in every film... no creativity or real talent, just a pile of rubbish covered with cheap glitter.Anyway... watched this film expecting to see two people singing on a hill and changing clothes every 5 minutes. But to my surprise there was none of that...no cringe acting, no cheesy lines, no stupid predictable story line. It was a solid story line with some great acting. I would say without a doubt the best indian film I've ever seen. For once it wasn't a cringe fest but actually showing the reality rather than some fantasy world where everything and everyone is perfect.I think anyone who gave this a bad review should stick to Salman Khan's cheesy films dancing in his skin tight jeans.",positive
1,Never did I think I would mark down a movie to a 1 star and think its too much of an appreciation for such a movie.,"I feel ...wish there was a Film-Tribunal with ""Intellectual People"" that could enforce a directive after watching a movie ""Pre-release"" and stop such Absurd movies from reaching the massess that just watch a Movie because a Certain Filmstar is in it...and make it famous/a hit just coz.they go Gaga over this persons riches and/or looks... Irrespective how deplorable the movie is... This strong-handed Tribunal (Even though impossible in today's underachieving 30s reel to 3 min. Video world..) should also have the power to reprimand such Directors, Writers from making another movie new or sequel... Until they prove themselves worthy of being at such a high post of Director/Writer of Hindi movies that unfortunately mold/shape the minds of todays Filmgoer Youth that are easily swayed into believing... ""If it happens in reel life..it happens in real life too."" ..
The movie got me gasping for a single scene that made sense in this movie.. And unfortunately in the 3.5hrs of pure-garbage...NEVER CAME. The back story,the moral of the story was great... And, could have been beautifully written for... A Fathers role in shaping his Childrens future and how a correct childhood full of good makes for better adults in the future... But, sadly such beauty never came... The movie is full of nonsensical scenes and untoward violence that was truly ugly for the world to see... The acting of Rasmika Mandhana and Shakti Kapoor (I would prefer watching Shakti Kapoor doing Dhakki-Chikki ~ Dhakki Chikki ~ Dhakk... Than watching this movie, anyday) was better than the S-Show that Ranbir and the others put on... Anil Kapoor was good in his role... Bobby Deol was, is and always will be a brilliant actor just Born in the wrong era of nitwits.I still feel...this movie should not have been allowed to release... And, everyone that liked this movie or gave it anything more than 5 stars...and, gave the movie any success (Which i know is a Hit)... Should have their Voter-IDs revoked... And, should be made to watch quality entertainers like 12th Fail, IB71 and Many other beautiful Cinematic masterpieces that make Bollywoods true movie lovers Proud...

1,Animal: A Ferociously Bad Film,"Animal is not just a bad movie; it's a cinematic catastrophe. Like a wounded beast flailing in the dark, it lashes out with violence, misogyny, and a complete lack of coherence. It's a film that leaves you feeling emotionally drained and intellectually insulted.Ranbir Kapoor delivers a performance that is both uninspired and disturbing. His portrayal of Vijay, a man consumed by his primal instincts, is nothing more than a caricature of toxic masculinity. He snarls, he screams, he beats people to a pulp, and yet, the film never offers any insight into his motivations or the depths of his internal conflict. We are left simply to observe his brutality, a voyeur to the bloodshed he unleashes.The narrative, a jumbled mess of flashbacks and non-linear storytelling, fails to engage or intrigue. It's a confusing tapestry of events that never coalesce into a coherent whole. The characters, underdeveloped and uninteresting, are mere pawns in Vijay's violent game. They exist only to be victims or enablers, offering no depth or nuance to the story.The film's technical aspects are equally disappointing. The action sequences, while graphic, are poorly choreographed and devoid of any stylistic flair. The editing is choppy and disorienting, further compounding the film's overall chaotic atmosphere. The score, a cacophony of jarring and uninspired music, adds to the film's overall assault on the senses.Animal is not just a bad film; it's a harmful one. It glorifies violence, normalizes misogyny, and offers no redeeming value whatsoever. It is a film that should be avoided at all costs, a cinematic wasteland that deserves to be forgotten.Here are some specific points to consider:Excessive and gratuitous violence: The film revels in bloodshed and brutality, offering no commentary or justification for the violence it depicts.Toxic masculinity: The film portrays its protagonist, Vijay, as a hyper-masculine figure who thrives on violence and dominance. This portrayal is both harmful and unrealistic.Misogyny: The film objectifies and demeans its female characters, reducing them to props in Vijay's violent world.Incoherent narrative: The film's story is confusing and convoluted, making it difficult to follow the plot or care about the characters.Poor technical aspects: The editing, cinematography, and score are all subpar, detracting from the overall viewing experience.In conclusion, Animal is a film that fails on every level. It is a waste of time, money, a.",negative
1,A piece of overhyped yet an utter failure,"This was one of worst movie Indian movieI have seen. The story lacks substance. It only had nonsense violence and vulgarity. Probably one of the worst directed movie. It seems the director only wanted to stir controversies because the movie lacked in every department. Ranbir and Bobby acting was alright but the storyline and the timing of the scenes felt out the entire movie.To be honest, it only shows what you can do with advertisment. I was actually hyped about this movie. In the end, I was only disappointed. The ending setup for a sequel. Of course, I am certainly gonna skip it, after watching this disaster.",negative
6,Yet another garbage on the name of masala movie.,"Makers have tried to make a Masala movie but they failed miserably. All the larger than life invincible characters generally need a storyline backing which this movie is lacking badly, there is only one character in the movie and the makers have tried to justify all his unnecessary and questionable actions on the name of Father's love. There are a lot of action movies south india has produced which is much more entertaining if not realistic. This is yet another kachara masala movie from bollywood which fails to entertain. Directors need to understand that their character doesn't become john wick by fighting with 200 people , wasted my time. Watch at your own risk.At the end father son conversation is good but movie as whole is not worth watching.",negative
10,'FATHER-SON LOVE LIKE NEVER TOLD BEFORE'.....'ACTION LIKE NEVER SEEN BEFORE IN CINEMATIC HISTORY!',"We must have seen many love stories on screen, full of love, mushiness and obsession. But obsessed love story of father and son was never ever portrayed in such an awesome way. What a splendid performance by Ranbir Kapoor....you completely nailed and raised the bar of acting in Bollywood to the next level, which will be impossible to reach by others. I have never ever seen such a realistic on screen action before in Bollywood. Everyone performed their characters very well but 'Animal' stole the show and yes definitely, stole the hearts of audience away with the intense and perfect acting. Waiting for the next part desperately!",positive
10,Scintillating and absorbing,"For those whining about misogyny, glorification of crime etc, get a life. Movies are there to entertain not to reform the society. The protagonist is not shown as a very nice guy but he has a justification for being over protective towards his family. And the deal about the antagonists being shown as belonging to a particular religion actually makes the movie very realistic; as it shows the practices of the adherents of that faith. Ranbir is maturing as an actor and he plays his role with full conviction. Rashmika is shown as a South Indian so she speaks with an accent. Don't listen to the nay-sayers. Enjoy the movie.",positive
9,Monster animal,"This is how a perfect picture should be and It's a blockbuster by RK nd SRV . Each frame of a picture is so beautiful nd mesmerizing. From the Stat to the end the only thing you see is red red and red . We entered cin the hall being a human and exited with being Animal. It's just superb. The way vanga presented this to us is just lovely. Now RK , bro he is the most underutilised actor in the industry.. The reason for 9 instead of 10 is because second half of the picture not before climax is low as compared to 1st half like in the first half it feels like the screen presence of RK ,bgm and screenplay just elevate you from your seats and let you feels that yhh this is what a perfect movie should be but in the second half it bends from 100% to 90%. Movie will not bore you or give you time to something else but second half is 90%. Madness of RK is just badass.",positive
10,Give it a rest with all the negativity 🙄,"People are so Butthurt over a movie that was always intended to have a deliberate violent plot. Ranbir is an excellent actor! Really liked this movie because theres nothing been worth watching in Bollywood for a long while. Ranbir portrays the darkness that people have within them very well and this just showcases what a person can be capable of (dramatised bollywood sytle). Never watched Rashmika before but really liked her. She nailed it. Anil Kapoor and all the other actors did a fantastic job. Bobby Deol smashed it too! He most definitely suits the villian role better than the romantic hero. The direction is next level and it really brings the movie to life. The second half took a weird direction for a while but then it came back together. The movie is a blockbuster and I personally would watch it again. Its entertainment people, not real life.",positive

It was a bang on acting wise. But if the storyline is bad, just acting cant pull it.Special appreciation to Bobby deol, he did great. Just a lil disappointed of why he was made play mute. I wish he has some lines.",negative
1,Disappointed,"I watched animal with a lot of hope, however, it turned out to be totally out of context. Blood, violence, mismatched action and above all portraying females as some kind of toy have just become the trademark of bollywood movies recently. As a trending industry, it is alarming to allow screening of such movies n lesson it is teaching to our youth which is already obsessed with social media..... wake up directors n producers before it's too late. I am astonished to witness such a pathetic storyline getting admiration on social media as its kind of a block buster. It's time v start focusing on social issues rather than making our young generation an animal.",negative
10,"Amazing film, Ignore the haters go and watch it with a neutral lookout as an film enthusiast and not some flag bearer.","The film is a masterpiece for any standard. The title 'Animal' justifies the character. Yes he is a Alpha misogynist person. But the film was all about a crazy guy who can do anything for family especially his father. The film doesn't pushes any ideology. Watch it without a pre judgement.There's a lot of hate going around the film, well of you don't like something you should not watch it. The film doesn't pushes a propoganda. Also, we are all mature enough to not get influenced by some film character. I went and saw the film with family, we all loved it and no it didn't made me kill people after coming out of theatre. People need to chill with pushing their opinion on others.

Movie I have ever seen. Don't waste your precious time watching this movie. Once again flop movie from ranbir kapoor. I wasn't expecting anything else from his acting skills.

You can't be so normal and be married to a guy like him.I don't understand why are all these people trashing this movie. If you don't like, don't watch it.

Some people will say it is misogynistic. There is nothing like that just feel the character Ranbir Kapoor playing hope you would be able to change your point of view.

It puts Kabir Singh to shame with it's ""wide hips"" comment. The character of Ranbir Kapoor is not loyal to his father's wishes or his wife. Also he is neither romantic nor action hero.Rashmika took the worst decision of her life to act in this movie with absolutely no role. She agrees or rather is made to shut up by various people in various situation. But she remains docule and meek. Also asking someone from hi fraternity to kill is similar to honour killing.",negative
1,An blind arrow,"As an ardent fan of Bollywood, it deeply pains me to write this scathing review about the much-anticipated movie, Animal, starring Ranbir Kapoor. Never have I witnessed such a colossal disappointment in the history of animal-centered films. This film, which promised to be a thrilling blockbuster, turned out to be an utter disaster from start to finish.To begin with, the storyline was a convoluted mess. Animal attempted to weave a convoluted tale of revenge and power dynamics, accompanied by some vague animal symbolism that lacked coherence. The plot never really took off, leaving the audience bewildered throughout the film. The narrative was poorly established, leaving viewers struggling to connect the dots amidst the chaotic screenplay.Despite having a star-studded cast, including Ranbir Kapoor, who is known for his exceptional acting skills, Animal offered nothing but shallow performances. Kapoor's character lacked depth, leaving him with nothing more than a one-dimensional protagonist whose motivations were unclear.",negative
1,Don't waste your time and money,"Worst movie ever!! Worst portrayal of father and son relationship. No story, no acting.. Only mindlessly shooting ppl!! The movie is so long that after a point of time you feel like killing yourself for booking tickets! For 3 hours it was only Ranbir on the screen, shooting and fighting, the other 30 minutes were for rest of the cast. The movie is wrongly marketed and that's why it has so many tickets sold! I wonder what the makers were thinking when they created this!! I have never hated any movie this badly ever! Wish thr was a negative rating option!! Naming the movie 'Animal' is disgrace to the animal Kingdom!",negative
3,An extremely talented actor misused for a shallow story,"This movie falls short primarily due to its shallow storyline, an initial passable build-up that takes a nosedive after the first hour, and poor direction, lacking emotional depth and concluding abruptly. While Ranbir Kapoor's stellar performance stands out, a film cannot rely solely on its lead actor; a compelling narrative and emotional continuity are essential. Unfortunately, the movie falters with abrupt scene transitions, leaving viewers unable to connect with emotional moments. Despite Ranbir Kapoor's brilliance, the film is marred by a disjointed and hastily executed second half, making the overall experience disappointing.",negative
9,Speechless,"This film is a cinematic triumph. Not made for the faint of heart or the easily offended breed. This is a case study of a psychotic man's psyche in its utmost illustrious portrayal. I can honestly say I have never seen a film like this before. Watch it and see it unfold for yourself while supporting novel cinema.Ranbir Kapoor is a revelation and has outdone his previous resounding performances in rockstar, barfi, tamasha & such. The rest of the cast is brilliant as well, so is the music & cinematography as well,Sandeep Reddy Vanga and the producers of the film deserve special adulation for their gutsy effort for pulling off such an immaculate movie.Once again, sensitive babies stay away from this. Only if you have an appetite for seeing exceptional cinema pushed to its boundaries, check out this gem.",positive
1,The worst Bollywood movie I've ever seen...,"I found this movie deeply problematic, particularly due to its portrayal of gender dynamics and violence. The script was confusing and difficult to follow, even for Hindi speakers. This lack of clarity extended to the storyline, which lacked a coherent message. The protagonist's relationship with his father was inconsistently depicted, oscillating between care and disregard. Furthermore, the portrayal of the protagonist's wife was troubling. She is depicted as forgiving and subservient, enduring his aggressive and possessive behavior. This film's success in India is concerning, as it seems to perpetuate harmful misogynistic and violent stereotypes.",negative
1,Worst Movie,"Is it required to show such level of violence, bloodshed, sex scene, mental disturbance as a main theme of the movie. Only noise, no story, no emotions, no drama. Waste of time, energy, money. It is better to watch stand up comedy, original theatre, drama or war documentary etc. Even Animal Planet or national geographic is better than this movie. Every adult knows how kids are born but it is necessary to show on screen to understand the scene like illicit relationship, inter-course to have conceive with baby.Actors/actress so called stars is not having ethical or moral stand. They are just focussed on money and publicity.Plz watch Dhruv Rathee review of this movie to better to understand the motive and purpose of such movie on you tube.",negative
2,"I wasnt sure what was the real story, what was the outcome and why the movie was made to begin with?","The film initially was abysmal, serving as a glaring instance of how our own cultural fabric is being eroded by gratuitous violence and explicit scenes. What lessons are we imparting to the upcoming generation? Why can't we produce movies that hold substantial educational value for society, celebrating the richness of Indian culture, and striving for a better world? Instead, this particular film fuels unrealistic fantasies in children, depicting mass shootings. It normalizes unethical behavior, suggesting it's acceptable to engage in extramarital affairs merely due to one's position of power. It glamorizes the desire for immense wealth and authority, portraying the notion that one can act with impunity, even to the extent of killing hundreds of people.I'm perplexed. While I acknowledge that movies are intended for entertainment and enjoyment, is this truly what we define as entertaining in today's world?",negative
9,Love it and hate it at the same time,"When you move out of the theatre after watching the obscene gesture by an aged Ranbir you are really offended that the director tried to play a trick with the audience but it really isn't so throughout the movie at all. Yes the violence is excessive, unnecessary and glorified inspired by many Korean movies I'm sure but the writer director keeps you hooked on for the most part of this 3.21 hour extravaganza.You wonder if this is the inflection point of Indian cinema post OTT revolution which has made the audience more mature and the routine stuff doesn't work anymore. Yes the movie has immense shock value right from guns, sex, unabashed talk which takes guts to produce in a mainstream cinema though it is meant for adults. A fantastic ensemble of actors make the characters lively and Ranbir probably gives his best lifetime performance as the grayest character ever written for him.Yes the movie becomes illogical when you have people singing in the midst of a all out attack, absolute absence of law enforcement, miraculous recovery (though a sick Ranbir is believable) mindless butchering and shooting. The editing is up and down there are moments in the initial part when it elevates the tension and there are moments when it seems you are left wondering what the characters would be doing and feel interrupted in the 2nd half. It makes you think all that the protagonist did with his animal instincts was finally down the drain as nature takes its course(this could have been portrayed better).Even with all the negatives the background score and music elevate the viewing experience manifold so does the black comedy. It seems as though this director is equally unabashed like his main character in his writing. The emotional scenes do make an impact and you can connect with most of the characters though the actions of these are outrageous and therein lies the movie's biggest strength.",positive
10,Animal,"In my opinion, it is one of the best performance of Rk. The movie is beyond my expectations, I literally got goosebumps on many scenes. Rk gave a brilliant performance!!!! He just slayed his character.Anil Kapoor rocks! Rashmika mandana also played her character very cool and their chemistry was too good! Bobby deol had a small role but he nailed it for sure. Overall I enjoyed every second of the movie. And I didn't get bored at all. The sound was really good! Waiting for part 2 only!!I'll only request you guys, go, watch it on theatre!! The experience is on another level!I wanted to give this movie 10000000000/10 🔥",positive
6,A differently styled mass film that many may not like!,"ANIMAL was expected to be a high octane action mass film with an emotional father son story underlying. However, upon completion, i realised...it's definitely what i thought but the way it's treated is something that many may not like or many may like. My verdict is somewhere in between but mostly towards the positive side.I want to start with the screenplay. This is what plays the decider. The film moves in a non linear fashion especially in the first half . The film heavily relies on conversations between characters and the tension that arises between them . Hence , anyone expecting an out an out mass film with action every five minutes or so is sure to get bored or disappointed. In fact for me too, many parts of the film felt really slow .The problem is that the mass moments in the film are few and far apart which is why mass lovers are sure to get bored in between. However, if you genuinely love to hear the conversations between characters patiently, you will realise you get sucked into the world of Animal. This is where the film shines. The conversation between Rashmika and Ranbir in the second half (the one where Rashmika was heavily trolled for not uttering the words clearly) has to be surprisingly the best of Rashmika and one of the best moments in the film.The mass moments are just terrific. That one college scene, the crazy interval sequence are some of the best in the film. Another sequence where Ranbir strangulates a close family friend (in the first half) is just brilliantly executed with the dying man struggling with the music beats . Vanga definitely has the potential to be a terrific mass director. Some sequences have gore and that's why the film is rated A .Somewhere I feel, the father son story gets lost in between. I thought Vanga would flesh out the bond really well but actually it's kind of mid. I don't really see Anil Kapoor in the film for a very long time. It's all Ranbir Kapoor or Rashmika. Also, many sequences felt a bit disjointed. The climax arrives all of a sudden and finishes abruptly.The film contains Vanga flavors of male chauvenism, controversial remarks on women etc that were seen in films like Kabir Singh so that's why many might find them disturbing while many might enjoy them (especially the men).This film is an all Ranbir Kapoor show where in , he gives one of his career best performance in a never seen before avatar of his. His voice has the proper intensity with rage . He nails the action sequences as well.Anil Kapoor does a good job as well but I would say his screen presence is overshadowed by Ranbir and Rashmika. Rashmika is given too much screen space than required.I was heart broken to see Vanga completely under utilise Bobby Deol . He doesn't have any more sequence than was shown already in the trailer which deeply disappointed me. He enters the film late and leaves within probably 20 mins of screen presence. Very dissatisfied here.Tripti Dimri has a very short role but is guaranteed a bigger role in the upcoming sequel.Songs are good but none as memorable as Kabir Singh or many other better albums that released this year.The crazy post credit sequence (which actually felt slightly inspired by Rolex in Vikram's post credit sequence) establishes the upcoming sequel ""Animal Park...come visit soon"" .Overall, for me this was a decent film but expected much more because the expectations for me were too high.",negative
5,Boring!!,"Animal is a purely Ranbir show with lot of scenes on anatomy, underwear, and other private parts. The scenes were polarized and nobody could believe if it would happen in a normal household. But it will happen in Sandeep Reddy Vanga's world.There were many scenes which u could directly cut out and could have reduced the marathon runtime. There is literally nothing to look for except the face off between Bobby Deol and Ranbir after the violent interval fight scene.The music was terrific and juxtaposed in a conflicting way. A funny song for the villain intro scene and an emotional one for the climax part which looked interesting.Boring movie!!",negative
2,Vanga's 3.5 hour long fever dream masquerading as a film,"On a serious note, it was such a let down. I guess if they just played the trailer for 3 hours straight, it would have been a way better film than whatever the heck this is.The story moves fast from one event to another in a matter of 3 hours and 10 minutes, focuses mainly on the (anti) hero but fails terribly to build the context of the outrage or the toxicity that RK's character surrounds itself with.Rest of the actors doesn't even get the chance to be an one dimensional character, rather their arcs fizzle out in the juggernaut of Vanga's OCD on male bravado.The screenplay is so weak in some places that the maker blasts every scene with overwhelmingly loud background score. But it fails to rescue the film from it's fate. The camera work only seems redeemable in this 3.5 hour long train wreck of a film.This cinematic masterpiece is a great testament of Vanga's drooling hard on after watching men ripping each other open for vengeance and claiming self righteousness at the same time. Vanga tries to evoke the nostalgia of boyhood, by his memoir of abusive school teachers, negligent parents, generational familial dysfunctions and hormone driven misfortunes but just ends up creating a 3 hour long cringe fest of a ""Alpha""-man trying very hard to prove a point that is just not worth proving at the first place lol.",negative
10,Unconventional yet entertaining !,A unique unconventional package that is entertaining. Yes length is a bit long but the performances and the overall package leaves you hooked on !. Don't miss it. All the actors are terrific. 1st half is pact. 2nd half pace slows down but necessary to show the various characters and their storyline. Climax is great. Awesome performances of Ranbir & Anil Kapoor. Rashmika was great as well. The violence is not for everyone which is justified in the censor rating of the movie. The unconventional and unique approach is something this film brings. To be honest many times better than Pathaan and Jawan 😊.,positive
1,waste of my time,"The film in question, Animal fails to muster even a semblance of quality, ultimately collapsing under the weight of its numerous flaws. From abysmal storytelling to lackluster character development, this cinematic disaster redefines the nadir of filmmaking.The plot, if it can be called such, lacks coherence and depth. Scenes stumble disjointedly from one to the next, devoid of any meaningful connection or narrative arc. It is a maze of confusion and unfulfilled promises, leaving the audience lost and disengaged.The characters are mere caricatures, devoid of any semblance of realism or emotional depth. The actors themselves seem disinterested and detached, delivering performances that are uninspired and mechanical, failing to evoke any empathy or connection with the audience.The direction is as haphazard as the storyline itself. Scenes are poorly framed, lacking visual creativity or innovation. Cinematography, meant to elevate the viewing experience, only serves to further highlight the film's inadequacies, with lackluster camera work and unimaginative visuals.The dialogue feels contrived and unnatural, failing to capture any semblance of authentic human interaction. Witless and uninspired, the script does a disservice to the talentless actors forced to deliver.Even the production design and soundtrack, often a saving grace, offer no solace in this cinematic debacle. The set designs lack imagination, feeling cheap and hastily put together. The soundtrack is forgettable at best, failing to complement or enhance any aspect of the film.In summation, Animal is an abomination in the world of cinema. A catastrophic failure on every conceivable level, it fails to deliver even the most basic elements of storytelling, leaving audiences bewildered and resentful. With a culmination of lackluster performances, an incoherent narrative, and uninspired direction, this movie is a travesty that should be avoided at all costs. It stands as a testament to the pitfalls of filmmaking and serves as a warning against the perils of investing time or money in such an egregious cinematic disaster.",negative
1,Do not watch even by mistake,"First and foremost, even if there is 1% chance u are watching this movie, DO NOT WATCH WITH PARENTS. Regardless the movie is filled with cringe dialogues, illogical scenes and filled with vulgar action over irrational aspects. It's a total waste of money, time and mental state. The best parts of the movie were the intermission, credits and ads. If u wish to just consume content with pure aggression, harsh blood splattering and adhesive content, then this movie is definitely for you. All the money was poured down for the actors, their dresses and action scenes. There is absolutely no trace of a story.",negative
1,Garbage! A complete Torture,"This movie is utter garbage! Never seen such a bad movie... no story, pathetic background music that does not go well with the scenes, poor direction, a complete torture. All you will hear is PAPA, PAPA. Bollywood has become so much worse with these pointless movies.Bobby's presence in the movie is hardly for 30 minutes, though he did well. There are lot of scenes that could have been avoided & made no sense at all. There is a lot of violence and you won't even see police in the whole movie. I'm very disappointed to say Bollywood is going in a wrong direction. Please avoid this movie if you can!",negative
1,"Not garbage, but a Cringe Dumpyard","The director is a psychopath, that is known with his earlier directorial venture, The women are always portrait in the useless shades with all abuse bearing character yet the lead gets the credit. If you were to look for logic from a telugu director you are looking at a wrong place. The audiance as such enjoys gore and violence, miss out on logic calling this an entertainment. The movie in comparison is not subpar, but a super sub par version with weak scripts and. Dumb dialogues everywhere.Definitely avoid watching the movie. Its a good 3½ hrs save doing something productive than getting a brain concussion watching it.Sexist, psycho, violence, cringe.",negative
9,"Enter the self serving, entertaining and dark world of ANIMAL","The movie has its flaws and loopholes in the plot as mentioned by so many others, but you can't deny the entertainment factor that is present that is unlike any other in Bollywood. The acting by the main actors are top notch and the supporting cast is not far behind. The BGM is to the point and the music overall goes with the scenes. The second half does lag a bit and can be very repetitive, but still over all very enjoyable and keeps you guessing. There are a few twists here and there that you will enjoy. Don't miss the end credits, the post credit scenes set the stage for a sequel that promises to be even more bloodier.Bottonline, go see the movie on the big screen with great sound and Enjoy!",positive
9,BOLD and ORIGINAL,"I have seen this movie 4 times and all of them were housefull. I love each and every scene and it's masterful execution. Film has strong emotions and has discussed very uncomfortable topics which no one in Bollywood have guts to even imagine.This movie is gem for any cinephiles who loves to watch original movies.Vanga sir has taken inspiration from Godfather, Old boy, Kill bill, Scarface and many cult classics of hollywood and used his brilliance to execute some wonderful high adrenaline power packed scenes in the movie.Ranbir kapoor has seperated himself from rest of the actors of this generation by his legendary acting. From the rage in his eyes to his face shaking with anger in every scene proves that he has lived his role. He is for sure the Superstar of this generation.All the supporting roles are wonderfully played specially the Punjabi clan, Marathi Gunseller.In the end I would like to kneel before Lord Bobby for stealing the show just in 15 minutes screen time in movie of 3 hour 21 minutes.I want vanga sir to continue this franchise with even more budget as I am quite sure that he has some crazy original ideas in his head.",positive
1,WORST Movie of Ranbir Career. This is only for psychos,This movie was so bad that I even don't have words to explain. There were few scenes which were good like the last scene of Ranbir and Anil and the one ranbir's speech to workers. 80% of movie feel like Kabir singh part 2 after marriage. These movies show the mental situation of Sandeep Vanga. He badly needs a therapist I guess. Women have shown in bad taste. Women will hate Ranbir after this movie. Bobby angle have completely been wasted instead of fake forced and cringe romance scenes director needed to add some more scenes of Bobby deol. Ranbir Kapoor acting was good specially in 2nd half but he should have not selected this movie.,negative
10,Speechless.,"Big thanks to the director Sandeep Reddy, he made wonderful film about son's love towards his father and Ranbir Kapoor lived in Vijay Role, his acting was superb. This is the first film that made me cry.First time I experienced all kinds of emotions in this film. This film includes great love, big violence, family bonding, rich feeling, action and more.Director Sandeep Reddy vanga shows how family issues/ enemies are dangerous and he also shows that what kind of problems rich people face. Every rich people need trusted people around them.Actors chosen by Sandeep Reddy vanga were superb, they did their job pretty well.",positive
10,WHAT A MOVIE!!!(BEWARE OF TOXIC FEMINISTS),"ANIMAL offers a poignant exploration of a son's fervent love for his father, despite his absence due to work.Ranbir Kapoor delivers a compelling performance, portraying the son's emotional journey from yearning for affection to navigating a harsh underworld.However, it's essential to note that while the film encapsulates the son's journey into a world often associated with an alpha male mindset, it does not glamorize or condone the negative aspects of his transformation. Instead, it serves as a poignant reflection on the consequences of emotional disconnection within a family.Over all Movies is Fantastic. EXELLENT ACTING/DIRECTION/SCREENPLAY.GIVING 10/10ALSO, BEWARE OF TOXIC FEMINISTS! IT IS JUST A MOVIE.",positive
1,Kindness leads us to humanity not violence and gun culture,"This movie not only glorifies violence and gun culture among the youth but also portrays disturbing scenes, such as a man cutting his opponent's throat, with applause and glamorization. It should be banned. Kindness is what leads us to humanity. It's a terrible movie, and I strongly advise against watching it with children.The entire movie lacks a coherent plot, sense, or any meaningful lesson. It's baffling to see people cheer and whistle as a supposed hero enters a classroom with an AK47, firing bullets on the ground. It's perplexing why we appreciate such scenes. The movie lacks any logical coherence, except for portraying males as alpha figures.",negative
10,Par excellence!!!!,"When the poster for Animal first came out, there was a lot of hype. I can tell you know the hype is real, the movie is amazing. Ranbir is excellent as a rebel son. His acting is near perfect. The screenplay is crisp. Direction is great. Dialogues are fantastic. Minor characters are super well written and add to the screenplay. Some scenes are pure goosebumps like the action sequence before intermission and the final sequence between father and son. It was a breathtaking experience and everyone should go watch it. Lord bobby adds to the mystic aura of the film. Screenplay slows down a tad bit in 2nd half but it picks up quicky after. Climax is well done. Please don't bring small kids.",positive
8,Bollywood Redfined,"One of the best movies in a long time. A lot of reviews before I watched where.people said that either you will love it or hate it. One thing I can say is that this is not a movie for the faint hearted or for those who are stuck in the past or literally who can't understand cinema.This movie is a cinematic masterpiece, a story bravely told by an unapologetic director who had a vision of depicting power on the big screen by showing the love of a son for his father or by showing a group of well dressed men creating havoc.I am short of words to express my admiration for Vanga who got ridiculed by critics, and he rightly said this critics are uneducated idiots who don't know better.Only complaint is that the last scene could have been better, lacked taste as his entire movie was a master piece and some powerful performances!",positive
1,Trailer magic movie opposite,"Really loved kabir singh, watched 10-15 times on netflix. So much emotions, powerful acting and storyline. Just loved that movie and can watch it anytime.Therefore when Mr. Vanga came out with another movie I was extremely excited.Trailer for animal is just so amazing. Opening scene of trailer of ranbir acting as a father such an acting man. So of course it draws the audience to theatre.But the movie is really opposite. Whatever you saw in trailer is the best part.Movie has not much to offer otherwise.Extramarital affair on screen by Ranbir. Just kisses, obscenity, vulgurness and no storyline.On box office this movie made 300cr in 3 days worldwide so of course from business perspective movie is blockbuster when made in 100cr budget.But the audience did jot get the worth or pleasure of watching this movie.Mr. Vanga really made con of the public by trailer.",negative
1,A Tragedy of Errors: Animal,"Oh boy, where do I even begin with this cinematic rollercoaster, or should I say, roller-coaster wreck, called 'Animal'? It's like the director took a crash course in how NOT to make a movie and decided to implement every lesson learned. The plot is more twisted than my headphones after being forgotten in my pocket for five minutes. I thought I was watching a Action Movie, but by the end, I was questioning my life choices. The storyline is so convoluted that even Sherlock Holmes would throw in the towel and say, ""I give up!"". The characters in this film are about as interesting as watching paint dry. I've seen more chemistry between mismatched socks than the so-called 'Actors' in this movie. The lead actor must have attended the ""How to Act Expressionless 101"" workshop, because his face remains as static as a mannequin throughout. And let's talk about the music! It's so forgettable that I can't even remember any of the songs, which is probably a blessing in disguise. I'd rather listen to a cat screeching in the alley than endure another minute of the film's attempt at a Action Drama. The Action in this supposed Action film is as subtle as a sledgehammer. I haven't cringed so hard since I accidentally walked in on my parents attempting the foxtrot in the living room. The scenes are so stale and over the top that even a time-traveling DeLorean wouldn't make them fresh. The editing is a whole other story. I haven't seen such abrupt transitions since I tried to parallel park for the first time. It's like they gave a pair of safety scissors to a hyperactive toddler and told them to cut the film. In conclusion, Animal is a true masterpiece in the art of unintentional comedy. If you enjoy facepalming, eye-rolling, and questioning the very fabric of reality, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, save yourself the agony and watch a cat video on YouTube - it's guaranteed to be a more rewarding experience. In conclusion, 'Animal' is a prime example of everything that can go wrong in a Hindi film. From a lackluster plot to uninspiring performances, this movie falls flat in every department. Save your time and money, and choose to watch something more deserving of your attention.",negative
5,Not booring neither intresting,"If being shameless is called acting then the director is definitely Sandeep venga.Some emotions are good but it keeps on hopping between wife, father , sister and himself.The funny part is ranbeer character cares more about his father who really did a bad job being father and less about his wife and kids.Expected that villan is from family.Fighting ranbeer Kapoor could not pull off, he has no mass appeal. He may be big but definitely dint feel he was the alpha.Too lengthy for a simple story and you won't feel anything after leaving the theater . The movie does not hold you in any way.Songs are good all thanks to arjith.One time watch on Ott.",negative
10,Ranbir Kapoor hass emerged himself as a star with this film,"Animal movie is a movie that shows the need for masculinity. Males should stand up to level themselves, lead, build and protect. This film shows that we must not tolerate nonsense from anyone. We should stick to our ethos and values and not comprosmise on them no matter who the person is in front of us. We have a very good performance by Ranbir Kapoor. One of his best in a different genre. He does his action also well, tells his dialogues also pretty clearly unlike his earlier movies, looks handsome and also wins applause for his role in the story. We have ANil Kapoor who also gives good support performance. Rashmika also gives good support as a modern wife. She has clearly expressed herself the way women of modern society talk and express themselves. Tripti DImri role was short yet she grabbed our attention. HEr one steamy scene with Ranbir is remembered and also her little dialogues on screen that she delivered confidently. Bobby Deol was a surprise talent that won claps and applause from audience for his scary intro. After taht he was okay. THis film shows the father son role in society. Father son relationship, how is it, not dicussed much or not explored much in the mainstream. Thuis film is also a stroy of rrvenge. Love the songs, music and the stoy of the film. I recommend you to watch this film as this film is a little different, you will feel something different from the movies contemparay. I rate ANimal movie 10 stars on 10. This movie has also shwon the ups and downs of a relationhsip and marriage. Need to give a dicalimer that the violence unncessarily added in the film must be consumed on entertainment basis and not practical usage. The action in the film is a plus point deserve the shoutout. SPecial shoutout to the unique machine gun shoot sequence in the film. This film has celebrated all religions, hindu and muslim and celebrated different languages like a MArathi song and a Punjabi song as well in the film. Do check this film out. Ranbir Kapoor has emerged as a star by his performance in the film.",positive
9,Animal on high drugs,"People have all sorts opinion about this movie. But let me be very clear - Don't judge and listen what people are saying , just go watch it . In west there may be lot of similar films but I have never this level of free flowing action movie coming out of hindi cinema .Yes, there is bloody action , over the top emotions and rage but I enjoyed every bit of it because I just went to enjoy the movie and pure brilliance of Sandeep Reddy vanga . He is path breaking fearless director who is trying to do something different in Indian cinema and we should appreciate it .Ranbir is awesome , Bobby is awesome, Rashmika is awesome. And action and background music is enough to pump you up .I am proud of this film as an Indian . We need more like this.",positive
10,Totally Entertaining,"Totally Entertaining story. Some movies should not be judged by what impact the movies are giving on the audience,the audience should also use their common sense realising the movie. The 1st half is totally the best ever Bollywood 1st half. The 2nd part of the movie deals with the real story and motive. Emotions of the movie Purely touched my heart. At Last,Ranbir Kapoor is the Real reason of the Film's super success. Sandeep Reddy shows us a nice story of a son who blindly love his father. But this movie contains extra adult scenes those are not needed to show the character weight or story. I loved the movie!",positive
3,Movie doesn't,"First part of movie is average where it is trying to establish Ranbir Kapoor character as psycho (Animal) but second half is too boring and doesn't just just justify the Ranbir's character. Some good actions scenes, but overall action/storyline wise it is just pack of random things to make it longer. Fully hero oriented movie. Villain part is very less and not powerful/impactful to make movie interesting.If you just want to see an action/hero movie, then it might be a good movie for you to watch. But, if you wanna see an action movie which justifies it story, character setup and overall makes it interesting, then its not for you.",negative
10,Pleasure to watch,The movie was a full package and worth watching. It was a pleasure to watch. Ranbir Kapoor was phenomenal and his acting skills are brilliant as always. Bobby deol was so convincing and the story was satisfying enough. Felt like watching a saga. The best part was the father son emotions. Would really want to recommend to all of those who are looking for something emotional yet wild. Direction was amazing. The story was portrayed with commendable pace. Casting was done so accurate. Once again Ranbir Kapoor was the pleasure to watch. Please do not bring children to watch. Felt good after a long time watching this.,positive
1,"Pathetic, tasteless khichdi","One word - pathetic. Another analogy is unhealthy & tasteless khichdi.No storyline, baseless romance, overly violent, obsense derogatory behaviour towards women. They have glorified violence, toxic masculinity and abusive/ unhealthy relationships. Movie gets slow in-between and gets damn boring. Dialogues are so poor that you won't be able to relate to the emotions. Scenes are not connected and plot is not well-knitted to deliver the uniformity or theme.There's no story around father-son bond that they narrated in their official trailer to fool people. Ranbir's acting is good as usual, nothing new, but I still don't understand what he wanted to communicate through this movie and why did he signed up for this movie. In movie, he is characterised as a psycho who craves for father's love & attention, tries his best to prove that he's always right, manipulates a woman who is about to get married to someone else to become his wife, later mistreats her, doesn't keeps his promise, have extra-marital affair and breaks this news to his wife on a karwa-chauth night trying to cover up with some useless excuse.Love is equated to sex throughout the movie, even when he's dying all they talk or discuss is just sex. Law & order doesn't exist in the movie, anyone can kill anybody, anywhere and even openly boast about doing so. Arms & ammunition, stain guns, butcher weapons are common and piece of joke in the movie.From religious perspective, it can be called a khichdi. They have mixed components from all religions. They have portrayed Sardars as violent bodyguards and muslims as ruthless butchers.There's nothing that one can learn. Instead it may just trigger the animal like & misogynistic behaviour inside youth since the director has glorified all the bad stuff.When I watched the trailer, I thought this movie might have a psychological aspect or there may be a good message around parents-kids bond but nothing.If you want to waste 3.20 hours of your life, prepare your mindset accordingly.",negative
1,How can anyone watch this?,"I am unable to understand why this movie was made. What was the purpose of the movie? There is absolutely no storyline, no common sense. No sense at all. This was the worst movie I have seen in a long long time. I do not know what I can compare this with as well. I watched the movie last night and I still want to throw up. There is no sense of why the characters are doing what they are doing. I am unable to understand why people are watching this movie. I regret not leaving the theatre during interval as many other people did. Release of such movies should not be allowed. Yuck yuck. Yuck that's all I can say about this movie.",negative
1,"Horrible, insane and chaotic","The only thing it tops is my list of worst movies ever watched..
One needs to be cinematically imbecile .. mentally unsound .. to scriptwriter, direct and finally edit.Although, the initial one hour... is interesting keeps the audience captivated.. and then the chaos rolls and gathers unprecedented moss.... irrelevant and illogical scene build ups to justify the end result.The whole premise of a son having unconditional Love and respect for his father which holds the story in first half.. loses its essence miserably. The movie never justifies his emotions for his father.In the second half... it's neither wife nor kids , forget the father , on which the story hinges on...
The unmindful abusive portrayal of female characters take the movie to next level of idiocracy..
Watch at your on peril..",negative

The only good thing about movie is their songs. Erotic nonsense scenes been prioritized to attract audience. Watching this movie is an nightmare. No entertainment, no good message.

1,3+ hour-long torture with loud music,"The film is directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, who seems to glorify the alpha male without giving him any depth or motive. The film has some good performances, especially by Ranbir Kapoor, who portrays a deranged character with conviction. However, the film suffers from a weak script, poor editing, and a lack of coherence. Animal could have been a compelling story of a father-son relationship, but instead, it is a disappointing and disturbing mess.Animal is a 3-hour-long torture that is full of unnecessary scenes and plot holes.

1,A desperate grab for Attention!!!👎🏼 PR OVERIDE!,"Unbearable, unnecessary, and mindless killing scenes that serve no purpose other than to shock and grab attention. Clearly inserted for shock value and attention-seeking, these scenes lack any meaningful context tbh.The performance of the female lead, Rashmika, is so bad and it failed to convey emotions effectively.Adding to the disappointment, the acting of the supporting characters specifically who played his brothers and sisters wasn't convincing, lacked the depth needed to bring the narrative to life and it made the whole film not enjoyable for me.It's quite evident now that the movie's popularity was more about marketing than genuine quality.VERY BAD!!!!!",negative
2,Senseless,It was difficult to connect dots in this movie.. the story does not make any sense.. people are singing songs when someone is fighting alone with 200-300 people in one go.. so many blunders in this movie .. so many people died and police was that state was not even in picture in such case. What a shame.. worst movie .. Movie should have some kind of story.. so that actors performance make sense.. this movie does not take you anywhere.. it has scenes and music that the only thing they can show us on big screen.. further.. i did not understand why this movie was soo long.. they wasted so many hours of their audience. Awful.. senseless movie.,negative
1,Filth!,"First and foremost, lets not call it Animal ... even animals are not so disgusting.The sickening storyline and dialogues makes me wonder if the writer and director are of sane mind?Everything that is unacceptable, misogynistic, vulgar in Tollywood cinema has been put on show here. Are there no decent screenwriters in bollywood anymore that we need to rely on such crap!How did Ranbir even agree to play such a crass character? And Rashmika playing a role demeaning a woman to this extent, awful!And the audience who are liking it ... what are they smoking! Can't imagine how any self-respecting person can watch the film.And no, you can't even laugh at those dialogues!!Just Sick!!",negative
4,"Messed up the film even if we ignore the morality angle, logic and toxicity. Kabir >>> Animal","The only saving grace is Ranbir Kapoor for me. I felt The VFX of machine gun scene was too poor. If the director had kept the film on the lines of Kabir Singh without making it too commercial, maybe the revenge part could have been more satisfying to watch. Having said that, the 2nd half was overstretched with Rashmika Mandana's scenes which were boring and the same energy was felt in theatres by all it seemed. Anyway, I have seen the people have loved this film too. So each to own. Maybe you could give it a watch and decide for yourself.P. S. - I loved Kabir Singh and nothing could beat that film.Kabir >>>> Animal.",negative
10,A movie that challenges convention all the time!,"Animal...hats off to everyone involved for making something that is so much out of the cliche, a big salute to Vanga's conviction and to his entire team for believing so much in it. The performances...the songs..placing of the songs...the BGM...fight sequences...everything came to the party!!! Ranbir Kapoor once again proves that he is the best of his generation...and one of very best in the history, after Rockstar this is his most soulful performance, he deserves every kudos there is for this! Anil Kapoor plays his part to perfection, so does Rashmika Mandanna. Tripti Dimri provides brief but much needed breath of fresh air to the story, her entry to the story is perfectly timed to witness Ranbir's complete transformation into ""Animal"". But for me, the biggest shock...even more than the post credits...there spoiler avoided :) ...is Bobby Deol, he is looking menacingly refreshing. Bobby was a sensation in the 90s, but I like his second innings even more! For the actor he has become, sky is the limit! This performance of Bobby is so impactful that it measures up to something like the character of Anthony Hopkins in ""The Silence of the lambs""!!! He absolutely deserves the accolades he is receiving. This movie is path breaking, it is so far out of the norm. At times, it is pushing the envelope so much that it is going to provoke some passionate debate and so it should. But one thing for sure, it cannot be ignored!!!",positive
4,"""Animal"": A Disjointed Descent into Stereotypes and Violence","A disjointed narrative, forced character motivations, and a harmful exploration of tired clichés plague ""Animal,"" a film that ultimately feels disrespectful to its audience and its own characters.The film stumbles through its plot, leaving viewers with more questions than answers. Motivations shift on a whim, leaving characters feeling like puppets instead of individuals guided by logic or emotion. Even the visuals, while occasionally striking, often distract from the story rather than enhance it.The protagonist and antagonist, unfortunately, fall into tired stereotypes, particularly regarding women. Their actions rarely align with their supposed motivations, and the treatment of the lead female actress veers into blatant disrespect. This disrespect extends beyond the screen, as the film normalizes domestic violence and revels in vulgarity, leaving a sour taste long after the credits roll.While ""Animal"" attempts to explore themes of revenge and redemption, its execution falls into harmful clichés and stereotypes. The film offers no nuance, instead opting for shock value and exploitative portrayals. This lack of depth leaves the characters feeling hollow and the message ultimately meaningless.It's important to acknowledge that films like ""Animal"" are not isolated incidents. Similar criticisms have been leveled at other films by the director and within Indian cinema as a whole. This shared trend highlights the need for a critical dialogue about representation, storytelling, and the responsibility filmmakers hold towards their audiences.""Animal"" is a disappointing misstep. It fails to deliver on its narrative potential, resorts to harmful clichés, and ultimately disrespects its characters and viewers. While constructive criticism can be a valuable tool for growth, this film offers little to redeem itself. For those seeking meaningful entertainment and thoughtful exploration of complex themes, ""Animal"" is best left on the shelf.In conclusion, ""Animal"" is a film filled with missed opportunities and harmful portrayals. It serves as a stark reminder of the importance of responsible storytelling and the need for critical engagement with films that perpetuate harmful stereotypes and normalize violence.",negative
1,Movie makes a man with total depravity a hero,"Sad to see why such movies become big hits. Is it a reflection of the society or its youth? Characters that should be villains are now a days heroes of movies: KGF, Pusha, Kabir Singh et all come to mind. May be soon people will worship real life villains, or may be that is what they do in some countries.Who makes such movies? Yes they are making a lot of money but at what expense? If illicit drugs are sold openly legally then they will be sold a lot everywhere. Of course then some people who make money selling such substances will say they are only selling what the people want. There is no morality left anymore.",negative
1,Censor board forgot to watch the movie,"Most Vulgar Bollywood movie of all time, includes nudity and infedility. Violence (brutality) at it's peak. There is a difference between bold and shameless, this movie is the latter. Please keep your family away from such movies. This movie is a disgrace to the Indian culture. Glorifying criminal activities and portraying them as heroic.Lost respect for Ranbir Kapoor after watching the movie. Celebrities must understand that the youth follows them and should choose their roles responsibly.Never ever going to watch Sandeep Reddy Wanga movie again in my whole life.A petition should be filed against the censor board panel who reviewed the movie. Giving an 'A' certificate doesn't mean that you can show anything to the audience.",negative
2,Too much unnecessary violence and weak story,"I finally was able to watch this movie on Netflix as there was too much hype for it. I was glad I didn't watch it in cinema.The story was weak and illogical. It wasn't that strong enough to beg that type of violence.Bollywood has become so weak that a crap movie like this can create so much hype.Only positive could've been Ranbir's acting.It seems some of the positive reviews and hype was paid promotion for the film. If it wasn't for social media, films like this would not be able to rip the audience.Shame on bollywood, try to get creative and don't sell us crap like this please. The audience deserves much better.",negative
6,Unnecessary Violent,Ranbir Kapoor has performed the character given to him well but that character is one directional not worthy of Ranbir Kapoor. The film is unnecessarily violent and show unusual love of RK with his father played by Anil Kapoor and yet he didn't talk to his father respectfully. Anil Kapoor on the other hand has nothing to do except slapping RK.Sandeep Reddy Vanga the director of the film is also setting a wrong example of male dominance where women is only a sex slave who don't have anything to say and react. Earlier in Kabir Singh too he has done similar things but he reduced too low in this one.Music is also not good except Satranga Song.,negative
1,Baseless,"Seems like Sandeep Reddy Vanga just wants to portray characterless, toxic and abusive male characters in the name of ""grey"" and portray useless and powerless female characters. Pushing an agenda it seems amongst the youth. Also, wtf was the movie's storyline? No base, no backbone, no foundation or structure! Just made a stupid movie for the sake of action and sex.The movie seems to lack everything but Ranbir's acting skills. 3 hours 21 minutes are way too long for any movie nowadays let alone a fictional stupid movie. The dialogues are bad, the action is unnecessarily gore and graphic, and the logic is missing.",negative
10,Absolutely bloody,"The movie is really brutally good.many people here misunderstood what director wanted to say ...yesss its socially incorrect but who is asking uh to idiolize or follow the characters...MOVIE is to feeellll the true essence of brutality,sex,crime and emotional that how an aplha can go to the extrem level yeah its not good for society to FOLLOW But to feel the true essence of these words and movie does its wonder full job show the extreme level of alpha mindset but as director said not to follow this mindset.yeah its disturbing to watch but it is what it is
The sandeep reddy vanga is like Quentin tarantino of indian cinema.",positive
1,Zero story line marketing done correct,"The storyline of the movie was profoundly sad, almost overwhelmingly so. It seemed to focus excessively on the tragic elements, missing opportunities to provide depth or a meaningful resolution to the characters' struggles. This relentless emphasis on sorrow made the plot feel one-dimensional and overly gloomy.Regarding Rashmika's performance, it unfortunately did not meet the expectations set by her previous roles. Her portrayal in this film felt unconvincing and lacked the emotional depth necessary for such a heavy story. It seemed as if she struggled to fully embody the character's complexities, resulting in a performance that felt superficial and disconnected from the film's somber tone.",negative
3,"""Narrative Depths and Cultural Authenticity: A Critical Examination of 'Animal' and 'Leo' in Bollywood's Quest for Originality""","""Animal"" attempts to weave a narrative around familial love but ultimately disappoints due to a lack of depth in the protagonist's drastic actions aimed at saving his family. The storyline falls short of delivering the satisfaction one expects from a tale centered on such a powerful theme. In stark contrast, ""Leo,"" a South Indian film available on Netflix, stands out for its excellence in suspense, portrayal of strong family bonds, and authentic action sequences. This comparison prompts a reflection on the state of Bollywood, urging the industry to elevate its storytelling and break free from the tendency to imitate other cinematic cultures.The heart of ""Animal"" revolves around the protagonist's extreme actions taken to rescue his family. However, the narrative fails to provide the necessary layers to these actions, leaving the audience yearning for a more profound exploration of the character's motivations and emotions. Without this depth, the impact of the familial love theme is diluted, and the viewer is left with a sense of dissatisfaction.On the contrary, ""Leo,"" a South Indian film, excels in creating suspense that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The storytelling in ""Leo"" goes beyond surface-level action, delving into the intricacies of familial relationships. The strong bonds portrayed between the characters resonate authentically, adding emotional weight to the narrative. This emotional depth enhances the overall viewing experience, making the film more compelling and satisfying.Moreover, ""Leo"" distinguishes itself with its authentic action sequences. The film opts for a realistic approach, steering clear of over-the-top stunts and CGI-laden spectacles. This authenticity not only adds credibility to the storytelling but also allows the audience to connect more deeply with the characters and their struggles. In contrast, ""Animal"" may rely too heavily on exaggerated action without offering the substance needed to engage the audience on a meaningful level.The comparison between these two films raises a pertinent question about the direction of Bollywood. It suggests that it's time for the industry to reassess its storytelling methods and move away from imitating trends from other cinematic realms. While inspiration is natural, a constant reliance on mimicry stifles creativity and prevents the emergence of truly original content.The call for originality in storytelling is echoed by the audience, as evident in the social media hashtag #BollywoodVsSouth. Audiences are expressing a desire for narratives that break free from the conventional molds and offer something new and refreshing. This sentiment underscores the need for Bollywood filmmakers to tap into the rich cultural tapestry of India and explore unique stories that resonate with both local and global audiences.The plea for real content in the hashtag #MovieReview is a rallying cry for substance over style. It suggests that audiences crave narratives that go beyond superficial elements and engage them intellectually and emotionally. By delivering authentic and original content, Bollywood has the potential to not only meet but exceed the expectations of its diverse audience.In conclusion, ""Disappointed with 'Animal'-a storyline centered on familial love but falls short on satisfaction. The protagonist's drastic actions to save family lack depth. In comparison, 'Leo,' a South Indian film on Netflix, excels in suspense, family bonds, and authentic action. Bollywood, it's time to elevate storytelling and break free from imitating other industries. Audiences crave originality-let's deliver real content. 🎬 #MovieReview #BollywoodVsSouth""",negative

1,"Brainless, Senseless, Violence","Firstly, the film's title is horrible. It has NOTHING to do with animals or even with animal instincts. If anything it has to do with two emotions:
1. A child's unhealthy devotion to his father.2. RevengeBoth of these emotions/feelings are not really characteristics of anything in any animal. Then why the hell would you name your film ANIMAL.The film tries to show that the Animal Kingdom is all about the fight to become an Alpha Male and that is all there is in the animal kingdom. Really????Even if you ignore the completely senseless title of the film, how do you get past the senseless of it all. How do you make sense of a character who can NOT only fly plans but also have sex AND go to sleep while flying a plane, who can single handedly fight hundreds of ""villains"" in one space with or without a gun, who can go ahead and fight off people with his hands just after a major surgery and a heart transplant...My advice:Go for this only if you're into

9,A bollywood masterpiece after quite a long time,"I know that there are quite a few different opinions on this movie, for me, it's simply a masterpiece. It's a roller-coaster ride of an experience in the cinema hall. If people are okay with movies like John Wick, if Pulp fiction and Wolf of Wallstreet are considered masterpieces, then Animal, undoubtedly, deserves to be in the list of Bollywood masterpieces ever made and be on the top 10. Ranbir Kapoor is unbelievable. I think arguably he is the best Indian actor ever born. While the movie could have been 20 minutes shorter, it didn't bore me for a second in the whole 3 hours and 20 minutes. This movie deserves all the praise and the box office success it is getting and more. Animal, however, is not for everyone. If you are looking for entertainment, a different genre of a movie and okay with violence, it's a must watch for you. It's a true cinematic masterpiece.",positive
10,Another Arjun reddy,"See the movie is good, it's literally an 3hr+ long movie honestly i knew after i came. Except the same vibe as arjun reddy and kabir, its best.People didn't expect this. Few parts could have been removed, but at the end in post credits it make sense. I felt bad for few people who came with their family. My personal opinion it was the best film of 2023. Just think it like Arjun Reddy and enter the theatre! You'll get all the entertainment!Many intimate scenes exist 😂 so just be care who your watching with. The first time they say his name "" Ranvijay"" it just gives you goosebumps, must watch and there is no reason to hate it yk!!",positive
10,Animal is mind-blowing,"People who did not like this movie have no real sense of indian cinema.This movie puts all other action movies at shame specially in bollywood.Next level action, Next level performance of ranbir anil & bobby.It has brilliant action, adorable romance & mind blowing chemistry between a father & son.After watching this movie one will think hard on how to improve relationship between son & father.We all have some part of ranbir inside us which is exposed in the movie brilliantly.All in All 10/10 performance of everyone in the movie which starts from the director and ends with the actor.",positive
10,Outstanding movie,"This movie is superb. Loved the acting of every character. The first and second half both part of the movie was great.

10,There are only two : You like it or you hate it.,"I have watched the movie on 5th December after 4 days of release. I have seen a mixed reviews by my friends surprisingly. I didn't understand what's the reason behind that. After watching the movie I have understood how audience are perceiving this movie. One who likes this movie completely a fiction guy and gives no importance to ethics , values or twists and turns but enjoy the action . On the other side haters are highlighting the point that it contains violence and romance and no point of love and some argue that the feelings of women are deeply hurt. So if you are a guy who have an history of watching action and A rated movies earlier you will like it and on the other hand if you are too concerned about story , message , no violence you will not like it.",positive
8,"Ranbir Kapoor Shines in Animal, Though Story is Conventional, Presentation Stands Out 🔥","Animal proves to be a compelling watch with Ranbir Kapoor's exceptional acting, captivating personality, and striking looks stealing the show. Rashmika Mandanna unclear dialogues and somewhat lacking acting skills could have been improved, while Tripti Dimri and Anil Kapoor deliver strong performances. Bobby Doel's underutilized character deserved more build-up and introduction earlier in the story, but his acting is commendable.The movie, though slightly lengthy, could have been trimmed by 15-25 minutes. Despite this, the screenplay is engaging and keeps you hooked until the emotional end. The concluding scenes left a profound impact on my emotions.The soundtrack, featuring songs like ""Papa Meri Jaan,"" ""Phele Bhi Main,"" and ""Saari Duniya Jaala Denge,"" are excellent, seamlessly fitting into the narrative.The portrayal of the father-son relationship is a standout, and despite the intense theme, the movie doesn't feel excessively violent. Animal succeeds in delivering a memorable cinematic experience.",positive
1,Worst movie ever seen till date,"Full of non sense scenes, bakwaaas story line, minus hundred from my side. DON'T WATCH THIS BAKWAAS MOVIE. IT'S TOO Lengthy. It's full of violence and illogical irrelevant jokes rather I must say PJs. Ranbir Kapoor is definitely a good actor but I was highly disappointed after watching such a low grade work from his calibre. If you'll go and watch this movie you will realise that you are made a great mistake by coming to the theatre as this is the never ending torture which continues even after the ending of the movie because few scenes are shown after the end casting and those are even more BAKWAAAS.",negative
4,Skip this movie at all cost,"No good story same old bakwaas Bollywood movies that people love, over the top 0% realism action with 1 guy fighting 200, bad same old stories that we have seen in every action movie, a revenge tale where someone wants to take revenge for something that happened to him or his family, you cannot relate to any of Ranbirs actions in the movie the guy has some sort of twitch where he can change from a normal guy all of a sudden to mad men who even loves beating his wife up, so many s*x jokes just to show that it's now allowed in Bollywood! Wait for Dunki if you want a good movie with good direction and story!",negative
4,Great performance by the Cast,"The crew has done a great job especially Ranbir Kapoor and Bobby Deol, BGMs are great but what the movie actually focused is too much of violence for the characters, too much of blood shed and unwanted male chavhanism in between has dragged the ratings down. No wonder the movie got A certificate but yes if you can't look too much of blood spill then better don't watch the movie. Also if you are feminist kinda person then don't watch this film as the characters were mainly focused on the men and women were purposely let down for unnecessary reasons. The whole movie focus on possessive nature and unconditional love by Ranbir towards his father who never had time for his son during the early days. This is a perfect movie for those who want to learn how not to be a father.",negative
6,Unnecessary Bollywood BS Ruined it,"To the Director of the Movie, Could you please Delete 2 Songs from the Movie and Re-release it so it's Finally Watchable? Since the only reason this movie is worth watching in the theaters is because of the 10 minute fight scene before intervalThe Axe Fight Scene and the Last Fight Scene with Bobby Deol?The songs were not necessary in those intense fight scenes. If you want to take it to John Wick level then emotional Fight Scenes were not the way to go.And there should have been more contributions from Bobby Deol and Not use him just as a punching bag.Hopefully the director won't make the same mistakes on the second part of the movie.",negative
10,I want more of this ... it's like an addiction,Now this i call a theatre level stuff..Love this movie. Bollywood should make more these kind of stuff. It's one of my favourite genre. The character building and all other characters were these they have done a fabulous job. Best of luck guys and i want more from you guys. Stop making stuff like ganpat and adipurush. Save your money and make more this kind of stuff with this. The level of acting and the the level of violence will really trigger the animal inside you. The kind of blood I've seen is just so satisfying to watch. Make things beyond my imagination and I'll treat you like god. Love this which has a capability to blow my mind. Keep up the good work. And best of luck for your upcoming project sir.,positive
1,Worst negative mindset movie,"I have seen many action movies where there is so many voilent action scenes. But this movie is not having any head and tail. Just to show father son love they showed such a cheap adult movie. Very frustrated movie experience. Except Bobby deol act, I don't find anything good in this movie. Overrated and overhyped movie of the year. Also length wise too long movie, now days there trend of short length movie or a webseries with multiple episodes. How can someone bear such worst movie for more than 3 hours. This movie is just running on the name few big names and few songs. No wonder, this movie success shows what is the taste of people nowadays.",negative
9,Animal Unleashed: A Riveting Saga of Unspoken Bonds in Bollywood,"Animal presents a poignant tale of a son's profound love for his often-absent father, encapsulating the complexities of familial bonds within its storyline. This film marks a significant milestone in Bollywood, standing out as one of the best productions in recent years. The actors delivered commendable performances, each contributing to the narrative without resorting to overacting, a credit to their skill and the movie's direction.The screenplay is meticulously crafted, ensuring that each character's contribution to the unfolding drama feels authentic and impactful. The songs, a vital element of Bollywood storytelling, are masterfully integrated, enhancing the emotional depth of the scenes rather than detracting from them. Each track resonates with the storyline, moving in harmony with the narrative's ebb and flow.In an industry where hyperbole often takes center stage, 'Animal' brings a refreshing change with its grounded performances and a well-paced plot that leaves a lasting impression. It's a cinematic experience that artfully balances drama, music, and storytelling, reflecting the nuanced relationships and emotional turmoil within a family.",positive

Worst way to pass time. Better to anything else, literally anything else than waste 3.5 hours in this... Didn't the actors and people working on the film behind or in front of the cameras watch the movie and didn't someone realise how mindless movie they are making? It's such a disrespect to women.

Pls give me the address of the director and writer, this is the first film which i got headache by watching it. I think the editor was busy watching another movie while editing. Finally one last question why did they even make this film. Worst movie.",negative
2,Celebrates Toxic Masculinity. No Storyline. Pointless Excessive Gore.,"The only reason why we were able to finish watching this movie was for the great acting- mainly Ranbir's. Bobby Deol's acting was great as well but he only comes in for about the last 1/4 of the movie.This movie has nothing more to offer.The alpha males of this movie basically take over the entire purpose of why police and the justice system exist and handle all the work they are supposed to do legally, themselves, like psychotic savages.Justifying the whole atrocious mania as ""protecting family.""That's the foundation of this film.There was SO MUCH gore in this movie that it loses impact and is shown just for the plain shock value, not actually contributing anything to the story.It's so ironic to see Ranbir Kapoor having agreed to glorify toxic masculinity like this while his wife did Rocky aur Rani the same year which beautifully teaches the deep negative impacts of such mentality plaguing our society today.I understand that movies need a negative aspect for the purpose of story telling whether that be a villain, or a messed up protagonist but it's very important not to GLORIFY toxic behaviour, as yes, that does influence society!If society can be positively influenced through movies then it works the other way around also! I'm not saying that a guy who has a healthy masculine mentality will watch this movie and become toxic, but the young adults who are on their way down this path or are already very toxic are being enabled in-fact celebrated through this movie!This movie teaches that violence, destruction, infidelity, murders are all justified solutions to problems if you can wrap it all up in the blanket of protecting family and that that's what being a strong and powerful alpha male means.Ranbir's character Vijay literally says ""That's why men have been fighting wars for thousands of years, sorry but we live in man's world!"" EXACTLY VIJAY AND LOOK AT THE DEVASTATION AND TRAUMA MEN HAVE CAUSED BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO CHILL. WTF IF YOUR POINT?!??It's sad to see movies like these get this kind of attention.AND OMG THE AMOUNT OF TIMES THEY SAY PAPA IN THIS FILM GAVE ME A HEADACHE.Another very important issue that people are not realizing is how the glorified violence in Punjabi/Sikh culture is purposely taken advantage of as a backbone in this movie to support the toxic masculinity shown, it succeeds in devaluating the Sikh culture down to ""they're great at having your back in a fight."" Like that's the greatest value Punjabis have - no empathy.I do want to recognize the immense selfless contributions our Sikh community has made in protecting our nation from foreign intruders, yes they are impeccable at having your back when it comes to self-defence/protection. There's a huge difference between that, and raging heinous war every time you step out of your house. That's absolutely not what Sikhism is about.The cherry on top of that disgusting narrative was how Vijay uses his kada (a sacred accessory Punjabis wear) to punch Bobby Deol in the face with. A kada is not a weapon.How disrespectful.",negative
9,Do you watch movies to learn about things ? Do you really ?,"Dont watch this movie if1) If you want to follow the logical part of your brain, this movie is not for you.

Forget Indian cinema .. how many Hollywood movies do you know that makes complete sense ?2) If you are the kind of person who has ever used the word toxic in a relationship or online. You will not like this movie.3) You think movies are made to teach people. (Its called entertainment for a reason)Thats it. If you belong to any of the above, it would serve you best to save your money.All the people complaining about the movie falls into above 3 categories.Not keeping that aside what to watch it for1) A stellar cast with superb acting. Ranbir, Bobby, Anil Kapoor, even the side cast (except the main actress, she fumbled with dialogues) was delivering awesome performance.2) Good action sequences.3) Sensational plot which will keep getting better.

I know whole team invested lots of their time for making this film. But instead of making this kind of movies make good movies which would give good message to the world. Movie is an art not a business. The main reason for daily increasing crimes is thriller movies. Nobody will get peace from fighting or watching fight. Instead they will too fight.,negative

Their characters are underdeveloped and fail to add much to the story.Overall, Animal is a disappointing film that fails to live up to its potential.

1,Worst movie ever,"I havent reviewed any movie on imdb yet!! But this is the worst movie i have seen I recently had the misfortune of subjecting myself to what can only be described as a cinematic catastrophe, a film that managed to redefine the boundaries of bad taste and storytelling incompetence. Animal (if we can call it that) is an odyssey into the abyss of terrible filmmaking, leaving audiences with an overwhelming sense of regret and a desire to reclaim the precious hours of their lives wasted on this abomination.From the opening scenes, it becomes apparent that the filmmakers had a spectacularly misguided understanding of pacing. The movie lumbers along at a pace that would make a snail seem like a speed demon. Scenes drag on indefinitely, each moment stretching into an eternity of boredom. It's as if the director aimed to test the endurance of the audience, subjecting them to a torturous marathon of mind-numbing mediocrity.The plot, or lack thereof, resembles a patchwork quilt hastily stitched together from the remnants of failed storytelling attempts. It meanders aimlessly, with characters appearing and disappearing without rhyme or reason. The so-called ""twists"" in the narrative are not clever revelations but rather desperate attempts to inject life into a story that is flatlining from the start. It's a narrative mess that even a GPS system couldn't navigate through.Let's address the performances, or perhaps lack thereof. The cast seemed to be under the impression that acting involves reciting lines with all the enthusiasm of a deflated balloon. The lead actor delivered lines with the emotional depth of a cardboard cutout, leaving the audience wondering if the character had undergone a lobotomy just before the cameras started rolling. Supporting actors were no better, displaying a remarkable ability to drain every scene of potential interest.Special effects in this film were a tragicomic spectacle. The CGI was so egregiously outdated that I half-expected the dinosaurs from a '90s educational video to make a cameo. Green screens were used with all the finesse of a high school play, making the characters appear as though they were poorly Photoshopped into their surroundings. It's as if the budget for special effects was allocated to a magic disappearing act, leaving the audience to wonder where their hard-earned money had vanished.The soundtrack, if it can be called that, was a cacophony of discordant notes that assaulted the ears like a swarm of angry wasps. It's a mystery how the composer managed to create a score that not only failed to complement the scenes but actively worked against any emotional engagement. At times, I found myself yearning for the sweet release of silence.Character development, a fundamental aspect of any decent film, was sacrificed on the altar of laziness. The protagonists were as one-dimensional as stick figures, with motivations so unclear that I began to suspect they were making things up as they went along. Attempts at creating complex, multifaceted characters were laughable at best and cringe-inducing at worst.To add insult to injury, the film shamelessly borrowed elements from other, far superior works. It's as if the filmmakers raided the clearance aisle of storytelling tropes, cobbling together a narrative Frankenstein's monster. Any semblance of originality was sacrificed for the sake of a cheap thrill, leaving the audience with a bitter aftertaste of disappointment.In conclusion, ""Animal"" is a cinematic disaster of epic proportions. From its sluggish pace to its lackluster performances, the film is a masterclass in how not to make a movie. Save yourself the agony and avoid this abysmal excuse for entertainment at all costs. Your sanity will thank you.",negative
1,Top 5 worst Bollywood movies of 2023,"The buzz generated by social media prompted my visit to the theaters for this film, but alas, it proved to be a regrettable decision.Despite boasting a stellar cast, the movie faltered in resuscitating its narrative. While the acting prowess of nearly every actor was commendable, the film struggled to establish a meaningful connection between the audience and its characters or storyline.Although the songs and music are good, its synchronization with scenes left much to be desired.Attempting to pack an abundance of content into a three-hour span, the movie often felt burdened with unnecessary and awkward dialogues, detracting from the overall viewing experience.",negative
10,Ranbir shines but Bobby Deol mesmerises,"This is a slightly oddball film. The story is quite basic about two families who hate each other and the film has some very graphics scenes that you don't normally see in Bollywood films (not suitable for under 18s). So if you're expecting typical Bollywood fare then this film doesn't provide it and I understand the low ratings are probably being given for these reasons.However, the acting of the star cast is excellent. Ranbir puts in a powerhouse performance and absolutely nails every scene. He handles the action and psychotic scenes incredibly well. But Bobby Deol outshines even Ranbir with his shorter and more intense performance. It is without doubt the best acting performance of Bobby's career. His entry scene to the Jamal Jamaloo song is superb and he steals the show with his dance steps that leave a lasting impression, as well as his emotional and action scenes. The performance of all the other cast is also top notch. The film is also well mounted with brilliant technical aspects and production values. The film dares to be original and deliver something different rather than follow a tried and tested formula, and full kudos to Sandeep Reedy (Director & Producer) for attempting a new approach. For these reasons I give the film 10/10.",positive
1,Pathetic experience,"Excessive violence detracts from the storytelling and may alienate some viewers. Additionally, a prolonged duration can affect the pacing, made me the movie feel tedious. After watching this movie i came back with huge amount of headache. The movie is all about nonsense actions. The fun part is there is no law and orders in this movie. Everyone can kill anyone as per their wishes. If i get chance to meet mr sandeep i will surely ask him that what is the lesson you want to pass by making this kind of movie by the way we all are at fault that we are making unnecessary hype for this kind of film.",negative
1,Slow pace of movie,"The movie's exceptionally slow pace tests the audience's patience, with a disturbing and seemingly gratuitous sex scene adding discomfort. The love story lacks clarity, making it challenging to understand the characters' connection. It feels like the director, Sandeep Reddy, is attempting to share his personal love experiences with the world, but the result is more perplexing than relatable. The recommendation would be for the director to consult a psychiatrist insights into crafting a more authentic portrayal of love. Despite well-executed action scenes, the overall lack of cohesion leaves viewers guessing and disconnected, hindering the film's potential impact.",negative
3,Ranbir is a wasted talent in this movie: No story👉sex👉👉No story 👉Violence👉No logic👉Half revenge 👉End.,"It's a pathetic story with no logic but Ranbir's acting was awesome, but still not worth to watch. Movie does not have any type of story or any Logic. If you want to watch, just want it without logic. Also, movie is soo long that everyone was eager that when will it end. A little story would have made Ranbir a Real Superstar. Movie series will go on but I don't know about logic. I will personally no recommend this movie but if you still want to watch, watch at your own risk. Hope Sam bahadur will be good to watch. Movie has some pretty action scenes as well but due to lack of logic and story, it failed to impress. Also, I don't understand, why background music is romantic while taking revenge. 😂",negative
10,It's a great film: very raw and intense,"You should experience this film in the theatres for sure! It gave me the best theatrical experience! Even after coming home, the film stayed in my brain for 4-5 hrs. It is so haunting! Sandeep Reddy Vanga's work and Ranbir's acting is extraordinary! Other actors performed well too.This film is engaging because of beautiful writing, directing, great-acting, and crafty-editing!Go to theatres and experience this cinema. You should watch it in theatre, and only then you'll experience the essence of the film. The audience will surely get indulged into the film because of great work done by the crew and cast!",positive
10,OUTSTANDING!!,"""Animal"" roars onto the screen as a gripping tale of familial strife and vengeance, propelled by the stellar performances of Ranbir Kapoor, Bobby Deol, Anil Kapoor, and Rashmika Mandanna. Directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, this film intricately dissects the fracturing bond between a father and son, with Ranbir Kapoor delivering a tour de force performance that navigates his character's transformation from loyalty to unyielding retribution. Bobby Deol's multifaceted portrayal adds depth, while Anil Kapoor's commanding presence elevates the intensity. Rashmika Mandanna shines, infusing warmth into the emotional tapestry. Through intense sequences and evocative cinematography, ""Animal"" plunges audiences into the raw emotions of its characters, though its unapologetic portrayal of vengeance might not suit all tastes. Yet, with a riveting narrative and a compelling musical score, this film stands tall as a captivating exploration of human psychology and familial complexities, a must-watch for enthusiasts of intense, character-driven cinema.",positive
10,Outstanding,"Review can end with one word BAWAAL you can't even imagine the way of presentation did by Sandeep reddy Vanga, this man is Indian terintino.If violence and aggression is art than this man is Michael Angelo

Please do watch the art crafted by violence and anger
Bobby Deol, man you are awesome, please do remember that no one has ever created such type of impact with such a short duration not even marlon Brando in godfather, you are the true animal in this movie,
Hats off to the entire team specially Sandeep reddy aka Indian terintino.",positive
1,Waste of time !! no storyline !!,"I don't even understand why people got so hyped about this movie !!It has no storyline .. some sex scenes, few blood sheds. Couldn't even understand rashmika's dialogues due to her weird pronunciation and accents.I fell asleep in the middle of the movie. It was too slow , ranbir kapoor did well but only one actor can not pull a single movie or is not enough to captivate you for 3 hours. Bobby had a very small screen presence, for 15 to 20 minutes in total probably. Without uttering a word he did his part.This movie is nothing like the trailer!People who have watched GOT will find the violence scenes meh ..

1,Scam - showed something else in trailer n delivered something else,"First half is amazing, mind-blowing n outstanding Ranbir Kapoor took the movie on above excellence which is unmatchable but second half is totally opposite disgusting, disappointed, horrible, dragged for no reason n totally waste of time n money.Bobby Deol is looking stunning like never before n has done amazing work. Being a main villain of the movie he comes for 5 mins n got killed by Rk like a road side Gunda which is totally heart broken n big disappointment. Every side character or even every person who is in this movie has an bigger presence than Bobby Deol which is a scam by the director who showed something else in the trailer n delivered something else.Pathetic.",negative
10,Osm,"Excellent BGM, magnificient cinematography and out of the world acting by Ranbir (what a brilliant actor he is!) fell short to save the movie ridden with lack of depth and emotion in the storyline. The loosely written plotlines and characters severely dilapitated Ranbir's character as well because the other characters were so underdeveloped. Lack of motive in even the central character resulted in a lack of conviction in the whole story to such a level that after taking in so much of grandly choreographed violence, one is left scratching head wondering everything happened for what exactly! Emotion got translated i nto only one sided shouting and the viewer is left alone to experience an exhausting and frantic TV debate show where only the TV anchor gets to shout.",positive
5,"Brilliant Actor, Bad Film!","I am not sure if this film even qualifies to be called as a ""Film"".' It doesnt have a cohesive storyline, its not even a proper montage. But its true to the name ANIMAL, bcz the violence, the gunshots and the blood shed is not for the weak heart!2. Fair Warning: If you're someone who gets easily influenced by a filmy character, you should drop the plan to see this film, first go, and see a Psychiatrist,
no cap!3. Filled with senseless scenes, weird dialogues, no character development, no logic, extravagant & over hyped & a big failure screeplay & content wise! I am not even including the topic of obsession, toxicity, misogyny, boz that is a plot of the character, you gotta accept it.4. Right HERO in a WRONG movie. Ranbir Kapoor's performance, his screen presence is unbelievably unmatched! But i am disappointed by so little screen space given to the overhyped character of lord Bobby Deol. Wanted to see more of his story & character development. He maybe happy for getting work, but as audience we wanted to understand his character, which was quite disappointing bcz it didnt happen.Songs and BGM is great, but at the same time, it is annoying in few scenes, the BGM is too loud & unnecessary that you would miss hearing the dialogues!5. Climax and the post credit is actual ""wtf"" moment. Sandeep Reddy Vanga what a waste of money and such amazing starcast! Nonetheless, movie will earn at the box office bcz of the polarizing view & hype. Sticking to the performance strictly, its a Brilliant one man show. But movie as a whole is definitely skippable at the theatre. It Will be streamed on Netflix, watch it then!",negative
1,Wasted 3 hours of my life,"I've wasted my time by doing many things that I don't regret. This movies was actually a waste of time. Such a garbage movie it is. I think the team has intentionally created such a garbage using such good actors. The trailer was really appealing so I went to watch this movie.The storyline, if one dares to call it that, is an incoherent mess of clichés stitched together with the finesse of a toddler's art project. The plot is as predictable as the sunrise, with characters so one-dimensional that they make cardboard cutouts seem lifelike. It's like the filmmakers raided a reject bin of tired Bollywood tropes and threw them all together, hoping something coherent would emerge.The performances, if you can even call them that, are a masterclass in wooden acting. The lead actors seem to have mistaken stoicism for depth, delivering lines with the enthusiasm of someone reading a phone book. Chemistry between characters is about as vibrant as a grayscale photograph, making it impossible to invest emotionally in their lackluster journey.",negative
10,A Cinematic Masterpiece That Redefines Excellence in Indian Cinema,"As 2023 draws to a close, ""Animal"" unequivocally secures its place as not just the year's standout film, but a landmark in Indian cinema. This Sandeep Reddy Vanga-directed masterpiece is a riveting blend of family drama, intense emotion, and breathtaking action.At its core, ""Animal"" is a powerful exploration of the intricate dynamics between a father and son, portrayed with such depth and finesse that it leaves the audience spellbound. Ranbir Kapoor delivers what can only be described as a career-best performance, embodying his character with a raw intensity that transcends the screen. His portrayal is complemented by the ever-charismatic Anil Kapoor and the versatile Bobby Deol, both of whom deliver performances that resonate long after the movie ends. Rashmika Mandanna, in her confident Hindi cinema debut, and Tripti Dimri, in her impactful role, add layers to the narrative, making it a holistic cinematic experience.Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga's storytelling prowess is on full display here. He crafts a narrative so gripping that it keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout its 3-hour-20-minute runtime. The film's screenplay is a rollercoaster of emotions, seamlessly weaving suspense, drama, and dark humor, leaving the audience in awe of the storytelling artistry.The cinematography by Amit Roy is nothing short of spectacular, capturing the raw beauty and brutality of the film's setting. The visual aesthetics are complemented by a mesmerizing soundtrack, where each song and the background score by Harshwardhan Rameshwar elevate the film's emotional quotient.""Animal"" is also a technical triumph. The action scenes are choreographed to perfection, rivaling and surpassing international standards, and the special effects are used judiciously, enhancing rather than overpowering the narrative. The film's bold scenes are not for the faint-hearted, but they add a level of authenticity and grittiness to the story.A standout feature of ""Animal"" is its climax and the brilliantly executed post-credit scene - a masterstroke by Vanga that adds an extra layer of complexity and intrigue to the film. It's these nuances that elevate ""Animal"" from being a great film to an absolute masterpiece.In summary, ""Animal"" is an extraordinary cinematic achievement that sets a new benchmark in Indian filmmaking. It's a movie that offers a profoundly moving experience, one that challenges and captivates its audience. Sandeep Reddy Vanga, with his exceptional vision, has created a film that is not just to be watched but to be experienced. ""Animal"" is a testament to the transformative power of cinema and a must-watch for anyone who appreciates the art of filmmaking at its finest.",positive

Anil kapoor have 3 expressions only in whole movie. Rasmika have single expression.Action scenes are ridiculous. Guy kills 300 people and police is non existent.Please avoid at all cost.

10,Piece of Art,"In decades, Bollywood hasn't offered something this exceptional. The background music, songs, and every actor's performance were outstanding. Portraying a dark character on screen was a commitment executed with perfection.Those criticizing it as ""disgusting"" seem narrow-minded. See it as a piece of art, not an educational chapter in history shaping your children's lives. If you're a strong role model, a three-hour film won't alter that influence.Ranbir Kapoor reaffirms his standing as one of this generation's finest actors. Bobby Deol delivers a commendable performance akin to Bollywood's Tom Hardy, displaying brilliance without uttering a word-truly stealing the show.",positive

8,A daring trailblazer in a lost Bollywood,"Animal is an extreme movie. It crosses most limits for a Bollywood movie. It is safe to say it has given Ranbir Kapoor the Godly status among Bollywood Superstars. It is for these extremes this movie attracted several polarized critical reactions. However in the middle of the criticism, there is a central, rare message of the movie that gets overlooked easily. This is one of the first Hindi movies that dares to explore the vulnerable relationship of a father and a son. And not in a flowery, unrealistic sense. Animal doesn't hesitate in touching upon how far a son can go in his dedication towards the biggest superhero of his life, especially when that superhero has been neglecting and accusing him all life. The chemistry between Anil Kapoor and Ranbir is dynamite. Anil Kapoor is graceful and super strong on screen despite his age. The next big, bold thing Animal accomplishes is establishing a strong, masculine and determined ideal for the falling masculinity of today's age to emulate, in a time when Hindi cinema has been plagued by a stereotype of ruthless feminism as an easy commercial win. From handling childhood trauma of lack of fatherly reciprocity to handling his torrid relationship with his sisters, Ranvijay (Ranbir) never lets life become an excuse to thrive. The movie portrays the subtle idea of bonding among lost brothers. And then there comes the inevitable test of a married man where he has to choose between his woman and his family. And our protagonist naturally chooses his father. However this couldn't be possible without the sacrificial endurance of his wife (Rashmika). Now, she isn't a weak woman either, however the definition of strength she chooses is not blind empowerment but becoming a strength of her man in the bad times. She's the one to stand by him inspite of his criminal antecedent. The movie gives Rashmika a launchpad to superstardom. However, Trapti Dhimry steals the show with her limited screen presence as Zoya. Now, the director, Sandeep Reddy Vanga is wise enough to keep his Ace of spades, Bobby Deol as Abrar as the ultimate climactic delight to the viewer. As bad and merciless as bad and merciless guys can get! This antagonist haunts your intellect for days. There have been cries of misogyny against the movie, however the degree of badness that the antagonist demands justifies the female violence committed by him. The movie sports some unusually good action. The more seasoned watchers may recognise some sequences borrowed from South Korean Cinema though it all falls as quite entertaining. Surprisingly good Hindi and Punjabi soundtrack from a director that has come from a Telugu background. CGI and VFX could be better though still a step in the direction of progress. Shakti Kapoor and Suresh Oberoi deliver a stable character role. The cameo role of Upendra Limye was highly entertaining. This is a necessary movie for the demasculinized generation of today. Don't let the conventional pseudo feminist rhetoric stop you from realising its important message for today's boys. A definite 8/10 from me.",positive
10,Outstanding,"Amazing movie. Ranvir acting is superb. He literally lived the character. All others are also amazing. Really liked the song and the story of the movie. A must watch. Really worth it.

2,7+ rating where this come from?,"What a shame people are using different tactics to raise the rating. 0 marks for content.

Shame for movie writer. Although, what was really appreciated were the actings of the characters.Punjabi song created hype but still not enough to watch this again. Miserable, pathetic and dissatisfaction. I love the way they started but the scenes were not connected. They were just stretching the movie with inappropriate content.",negative
8,"""Subdued Fury: 'Animal' Redefining Cinematic Realms""","In the dynamic realm of recent cinema, this film emerges as a trailblazer, boldly diverging from the commonplace narratives that saturate the industry. Amidst exceptions like Bahubali and KGF, it shines as a paragon of authenticity, delivering a refreshing experience.Venturing into emotional depths, it stands as one of the most evocative films to date. The film's narrative unfolds in two compelling halves, with the initial part providing riveting entertainment and intensity, while the latter intensifies, especially with Bobby Deol's entrance. Sandeep Reddy Vanga's audacious storytelling steals the spotlight, establishing ""Animal"" as a standout in the current cinematic landscape.The film doesn't shy away from visceral violence, creating a benchmark that is both overwhelming and captivating. Ranbir Kapoor's remarkable performance ignites this violent revenge saga, showcasing his prowess and further solidifying his stature as the superstar of Indian cinema. AK excels in confrontational scenes, and Bobby exudes a menacing presence, even if their roles are relatively limited.Rashmika's commendable performance adds another layer to the film, making it a must-watch for those in search of a gripping and meticulously crafted cinematic experience.",positive

He effortlessly transitions between intense dramas and lighthearted comedies, showcasing his versatility and range. Whether he's a troubled rockstar, a charming lover, or a vulnerable individual, Kapoor immerses himself completely into each character.",positive
8,John Wick once killed 3 guys in a bar with just a pencil...A solid 8 for this Action extravaganza by the Indian Film Industry,"I will attempt at analysing some of the reactions & largely polarising reviews this movie has received from critics & audiences alike.Excessive violence - Viewers, this movie is part of the action genre. Recall some scenes from the Western & International cinemas where the same set of people were in total awe of the violence shown on screen and in some instances with body counts & gore far greater than in Animal. Eg. Battle of the Bastards, Ramsay Bolton's death, Theon Greyjoy's dismemberment & several other far more brutal scenes from GOT. Gruesome scenes from the The Revenant for which Leo DiCaprio won an Academy award. The entire Saw franchise hailed as responsible for reviving the horror genre. The list goes on.Misogyny - there are tons of movies & tv series on OTT with Misandry in disguise of being Feminist & women empowerment. But staying on misogyny naming a few award winning critically acclaimed movies - The Wolf of Wallstreet, Babylon, sleazy item numbers, Bollywood sex comedies such as Garam Masala, Masti series, many of Akshay Kumar & Emraan Hashmi's movies at their peak etc. That passed as super hits.So let's be real & give credit where credit is due guys. The folks making this movie have a done a darn good job & I will await the sequel.",positive
10,"Nice to watch, you will love it","Already topping the box office in India, Sandeep Reddy Vanga's bombastic action film is high on shock tactics and low on substance. His first two features, the Telugu-language Arjun Reddy (2017) and its Hindi remake Kabir Singh (2019) were both megahits - and also attracted criticism for making heroes out of misogynistic, violent men. Far from stepping back from this, Animal sinks even further into regressive depths, resulting in one of the vilest protagonists to have graced the big screen.Vijay, played by Hindi cinema royalty Ranbir Kapoor, is the only son of a wealthy family. He grows up in the shadow of his father Balbir Singh (Anil Kapoor), whose attention is wrapped up in his steel company. Zigzagging between different timelines spanning Vijay's childhood to his autumnal years, Animal charts how his cravings for love and validation leads to a cycle of bloodshed with his inner turmoil basically a pretext for an onslaught of increasingly gory shootout sequences. At one point, Vijay quite literally murders hundreds of ruffians, all in the name of protecting his father. The swaggering, gratuitous violence aims to disturb, yet the execution of the action scenes is entirely forgettable and derivative, a poor man's version of The Godfather or Scarface.",positive
10,Blockbuster! Entertaining! Brilliant Performances!,This movie is really a great comeback for Bobby Deol who stole the show the moment he appeared on the screen. And to do that after the premise set by Ranbir Kapoor and Anil Kapoor's spectacular performances makes it count that much more.Ranbir is phenomenal throughout the movie filled with twists and action. He has portrayed his role with accuracy and excellence to establish his character quite effortlessly. Kudos to the music composer for adding substances to the scenes with thumping background scores.The thriller keeps you at the edge of your seats and glued to the screen as the director takes you on a voyage of daring action sequences and impactful dialogues.,positive

Whole movie is on Ranbir Kapoor's . And he did total justice to it. His Looks, Aggressions, Dialogue, Acting, Body Language...everything is TRUE to ANIMAL. And If You cant cry when Shakti Kappor holds Ranbir in the climax, YOU DONT DESERVE TO CRICIZE THIS MOVIE.

People complaining about length is not appropriate because the length gives us more time and explanation about the characters of the movie .The movie have that Bollywood touch which is not much liked by the people .People do hate Ranbir character for his actions , emotions , style .

He has again outdone himself.",positive
8,"8 for Theme, 2 deducted for Vulgarity!","I personally find a connection with the theme of the film which is the bond between a son and a father. It has been a tough bond with told and untold feelings, complaints and sorrows. Still they are one in the name of family. Ranbir's character was a trure Sigma family Man. Who atleast doesn't belong to our gendu GenZ generation. He loves his family, he cares about her sisters, his village and his brothers, he is responsible for the family and business after his father....... The revenge part was totally justified. The action was up to the mark of excellence.Don't get into the sold reviews of Leftists and Feminists! They are the only ones who got bullied (or even hurt) by this movie. It's not a typical b'wood movie, it's a Sandeep Reddy Vanga Movie.I only dislike 3 things 1- The old man character of Ranbir, skin show of the females (which was there only for 10 minutes, I can ignore this for a 3.30 hr long film) and Ranbir's Chain smoking.At last but not the least, Tripti Dimri doesn't deserve what she is getting. I loved her earlier characters but now I hate her.Now go watch this movie in theatres!",positive
1,Pathetic!,"Totally time waste! Full patriarchal mindset, male ego, unnecessary violence. Disappointed. Stop collaborating with the south, can't watch such nonsense.A few scenes will want you leave the movie and get out of the theatre. Terrible message being given to the people watching. All they did was portraying cringe stuff as ""cool"". I don't usually watch Bollywood or Tollywood movies due to their cringe content. I should have chosen the same this time. Money wasted, time wasted. If you love cringe, you will love the movie. If you watch things with sensible content, you might be writing a frustrated review on this soon!!!",negative
1,Toxic No Storyline EVERYTHING IS A MAYHEM,"Its basically KABIR SINGH's attitude, JHON WICK with INDIAN powers and i dont know what else to say its freaking useless and i wonder how ot got 7.3 ratings in imdb. Also theres the problems wigh misplaced dialogues and no logic at all .THE SONG played in the last fight was totally out of place not fitting woth the scene man DONT WATCH and promote thos kind of movies Vikram is much better than this movie man its totally a waste of time and no sense whatsoever. Bobby and Anil ji were totally wasted bro if i had to say better watch SAM BAHADUR it woild be much better to promote that movie rather than this movie.",negative
9,"Not for the leftist, liberals and pseudo feminists!","Animal(2023) : This Cinematic Spectacle directed by Mr. Sandeep Reddy Vanga is almost flawless in almost every aspect. From Acting to background score to direction everything is PERFECTLY done. However if you start netpicking its flaws then you can say thaBOBBY DEOL deserved more screentime. The action of the film is raw and gruesome, the mid-interval action scene is one the best in the history of Indian Cinema. The second half is however more tilted towards the drama side which doesn't feel bad at all but just enhances the quality of the film. Though the Zoya story arc provides depth to the story, I think that screentime should've been provided to Bobby Deol. The post credit scene is awesome, the intensity in Ranbir's eye is horrendous. RANBIR KAPOOR is one of the best thing about this film his acting is anything above your imagination. Anil Kapoor does well too.. rashmika performance is ok. You can easily watch this film 2-4 times in the theatres. Background score by Harshwardhan Rameshwar is thrilling and songs are good too, they don't feel like they're here to stretch the film's length. 9⭐/10✨.",positive
10,For Ranbir and Lord Bobby,"What a acting by Ranbir and Lord Bobby.This is new generation of Cinema.Sandeep Direction was Very Creative

Tripti dimri performance was so good with song of Pehele bhi sung by Vishal so lovely voice what a touch we connect with movie.Anil Kapoor performance was Like Jhakaas
Rashmika did go job but We love National Cruse tirpti dimri.Action sequence was amazing like corridor fight scene was very well executed with song of Arjan valley.Made in India machine gun.Now I am waiting Animal Park which is more
Violent than First.",positive
1,Trash,The movie has no storyline. This is my first review on any movie and on any platform but after watching this movie I was really disappointed that I wasted my 4 hours on something like this. Better to see animals in zoo and definitely it will be more interesting because at least you will find the variety and less voilence and in jungle animals do hunt or kill because of their necessity. Someone said on social media that if the storyline is not good than they tend to show voilence and physical intimacy and it makes sense to me. Don't waste your money and time on such a bad movie because Bollywood is producing really good movies and sadly very few good movies does well on the box office.,negative

10,I was glued to my seat till the end,"Extremely intense, dark and bold movie for its emotions background music, action scenes and what a FANTASTIC set of performances by both Ranbir Kappor and Anil Kapoor. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and never wanted to leave my seat until the very last scene. People who love that kind of 'Masala' movies may not like this, as this one is very stylish and a movie made with lot of emotions and very dark intensity. I did not blink my eyes watching this movie throughout. Lenght of the movie never bacame an issue for me. At the end, I immediately said to wife, 'Are they making a sequel?'I am not sure why such low ratings or negative reviews from so many. As mentioned, not the ordinary 'Masala' movie. It is extra-ordinary saga and will definitely turn into a cult classic, people will only realize later.Highly recommend to enjoy the experience in cinema halls on big sreen.Sincere thanks and congratulations to the entire team and especially to Ranbir Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and the Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga and the team that produced such an intense background music together with such intense and soulful vocals. Thank you all very much. Hope you will give us a sequel too PLEASE.",positive
1,Just Blood....no storyline....only noise,"This is not a movie. Just a portrayal of angry and blood thirsty son. No storyline. The story is totally disjointed and make no sense at all. Total filmy and show that days of good and sensible cinema are over. Could not figure out as to how this movie is a hit.....Honestly, not to my linking. Punjabi songs are good but rest all is a total crap. Young person going on a killing spree of 200-300 people single handed with plunging axe in them....getting Rolls Royce customised with the colour of love bite....so vague and not even near to 0.000000001% reality. Bobby was good but seems wasted in the movie.",negative
7,The director's vision was palpable in this movie. The actors seemed to be mere instruments for his expression.,"The story overall is an intense expression of emotions. Father son relation, sister brother relation and wife and husband relation. It even covers the families loyalty towards each other. However, the entire movie is male dominant and talks about the alphas and women merely play a small role and are completely consumed into Vijays life. Vijay also contradicts himself in situation and is not loyal to his wife while his relation early on promises that. He even contradicts himself when he is completely consumed with one goal and totally ignores his kids while he expects that from his father. His wife has completely no influence on him and has absolutely no value. The intimacy between them also seemed very poor. Most of the intimate scenes lacked chemistry. All in all, Vijay is a very stubborn, over confident guy who has his own right and wrong and sticks to it completely. On the contrary, Bobby deols acting skills were extraordinary. Rather was great too but Bobby totally stole the show. All in all, atkeast for me I saw the director in Rabhir, Bobby and Anil. It felt like it was the director and actors merely a tool to express his vision.""
Hello, this is Bing. I can help you with editing your review. Here is a possible revised version:""The story is a powerful portrayal of various emotions and relationships. It explores the bonds between father and son, sister and brother, and husband and wife, as well as the loyalty within the family. However, the movie is dominated by the male perspective and the alpha mentality. The female characters have little agency and are overshadowed by Vijay's life. Vijay himself is inconsistent and hypocritical. He breaks his promises to his wife, neglects his children, and demands respect from his father. His wife has no influence on him and is treated as worthless. The intimacy between them is unconvincing and lacks chemistry. Vijay is a stubborn and overconfident man who follows his own moral code. Ranbhir's acting was great. On the other hand, Bobby Deol's performance is outstanding. Ranbir Kapoor is also good, but Bobby steals the show. For me, the movie reflects the director's vision more than the actors' skills.",positive
10,Why people are giving bad reviews,"I dont understand what people doesn't like in this movie. Why are they giving bad reviews to this. This is the best movie Bollywood ever made. Ranbir's acting was 10/10. Bobby deol was fabulous. People giving bad reviews are probably week that they couldn't handle such a strong movie full of action acting drama story. This movie brings u everything that was missing from bollywood. The best movie I've ever watched. Full of dopamine adrenaline. Not a single time when we felt bored sitting there. Arjun velly ne was the best song in the movie and the action was top notch .....

10,Amazing,Its a 3 hour movie and didnt feel that way. I loved it ! It was engrossing and phenomenal. I get how some scenes/ instances/gore may offend people but dont take it seriously. Its a movie. Ranbir Kapoor deserves an award multiple awards. He was just brilliant. Bollywood is evolving big time and this was a step above the usual. Anil kapoor Bobby Deol the actress were all great performances as well. Bobby Deol was a surprise as seeing him after a long long time. Songs were beautiful. Dont miss out on this PHENOMENAL masterpiece. MUST watch. As long as it was three hours didnt even feel that way !!!,positive
6,Animal (2023): A Rollercoaster of Expectations,"""Animal (2023) starts strong, with the first 30 minutes creating expectations reminiscent of 'Gangs of Wasseypur.' However, it veers off course with an excess of gratuitous scenes, particularly in the realm of sex and beds, wasting valuable time. Despite this, the impeccable acting by the entire cast is a saving grace. Ranbir delivers a flawless performance in the action sequences, yet the film elicits mixed feelings, deviating from audience expectations. Overall, 'Animal' falls short of what was anticipated. Animal' is a cinematic journey that leaves viewers with a complex mix of emotions and a lingering sense of what could have been.",negative

Bobby deol is good in this movie, I liked his part in a movie after a long time. Anil Kapoor was also on top notch of his acting. Overall a full entertainer and a full package. A Movie which needs to be watched in theater only, home audio will not give the feel of the action scenes. The director kept the Actress style as it is, did not change her to north Indian accent.

10,Ultimate Cinema - Salute to Sandeep Reddy,"Sandeep Reddy Vanga's ""Animal"" is a captivating cinematic experience that delves into the dark and intricate world of power, vengeance, and family ties. Set against the backdrop of a ruthless business empire, the film follows the transformation of a young man as he navigates the treacherous waters of corruption, betrayal, and the insatiable hunger for power.Ranbir Kapoor delivers a tour-de-force performance as the protagonist, embodying the intensity and emotional turmoil of a man consumed by a thirst for vengeance. His character's journey from a naïve and idealistic youngster to a hardened and ruthless individual is both captivating and heartbreaking.Vanga masterfully weaves together a web of complex relationships, exploring the bonds of family, the depths of betrayal, and the lengths to which individuals will go to protect their loved ones. The film's narrative is driven by a relentless pace, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats as the story unfolds.The film's visual style is equally impressive, with Vanga employing a gritty and realistic aesthetic that perfectly complements the film's dark and intense tone. The cinematography captures the raw emotions of the characters and the stark contrast between the opulence of the business world and the gritty reality of the streets.""Animal"" is not for the faint of heart, as it tackles themes of violence, corruption, and the destructive power of unchecked ambition. However, for those seeking a gripping and thought-provoking cinematic experience, Vanga's film delivers on all fronts.In conclusion, ""Animal"" is a powerful and well-crafted film that showcases Vanga's directorial prowess and Ranbir Kapoor's exceptional acting talent. It is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll, leaving you questioning the nature of power, the depths of human emotion, and the unbreakable bonds of family.",positive
1,Senseless Storyline and questionable choices in depicting female characters in the film,"This film seems to have enrolled in the School of Absurdity, offering a masterclass in how to be a certified rowdy/ Gunda with a degree in inappropriate behavior. It seems the female characters were treated like props rather than people, turning the movie into a misguided tutorial on how not to portray women. In film even the maid got a front-row seat to the ""take off your clothes"" spectacle, turning the film into a bizarre. Lord Bobby Deol steals the spotlight with his guide on how not to treat wives. It's a rollercoaster of senselessness, blending action and sex scenes in a way that makes you question the plot and ponder the meaning of life.If I give star-rating to this film then this one gets a black hole - zero stars for the senseless storyline and the questionable choices in depicting female characters.",negative
1,Not even a proper cringe,"This movie is a whole hearted attempt at being problematic in every sense and I would've ignored or even enjoyed that part had it been made properly. I am not even going to delve into the themes it explores as there's enough said about the lack of depth in that department but even cinematic aspects of screenplay, music and action this movie fails to gather any momentum. I knew that SRV has no meat as a filmmaker but now I also know that as an audience he is below average. If his epic action magnum opus is just about blood splatter and made up canons with no sense of choreography or tension. What a waste of energy all around.",negative
8,Sandeep Reddy Vanga,"'Violence, violence, violence, I don't like it, I avoid! But violence likes me, I can't avoid'- Sandeep Reddy Vanga. As Mr. Vanga had said in his interview he would show what violence is, he shows it! This film is gruesome, wild and unapologetic!With a simple story and brilliant screenplay this film becomes a perfect film, each actor is fantastic in their job and the background score is the cherry on the cake.Based on a relationship between father and son carved in blood it shows a narcissistic father and a mad son who can do anything to please his father yet he is not pleased which eventually leads his son to become a psychopath and achieve by any means validation from his father!",positive
10,Please don't waste your money,"There is nothing in this movie,which goes beyond the trailer. There are loose ties in the movie. No rapport shown with any character except the one who he sees for a week. Ranbir is exceptional but the story let's him down. There is no fear of Bobby Deol in this movie. So killing him and winning over doesn't give me a full circle. Dad doesn't understand till the very end his half cooked love from his son. All in all blood shed and more blood shed.Also the leading love and storyline gives me nothing to love about. She is as good as nothing in the movie and I hope this gets to people who don't want to waste there money. The movie is way to long.",positive
1,Worse movie ever,"I have never seen any movie this worse. I feel that I literally wasted my 3 hours time and money on this crap movie. There is no option to give zero rating hence giving 1 star but this movie gets straight zero from me. The portrayal of women was really bad and dint like at all. Felt to run away from theatre during 2nd half of the movie. Unnecessarily lengthy movie. Comedy was not at all connecting. Ugly comedies where one feel very awkward after hearing them. No storyline at all. No good son paapa connection which was claimed by them in trailer. At the end of first half only I felt like movie is over. If they had put ""the End"" at that time itself it would have got better ratings than now! Super pathetic.",negative
8,It's not Animal it is monster movie,"Animal movie is it's kind of movie you can't compare it from other film ,for sure there are great violence movie but not like animal.From Start to end it was a fantastic journey every moment was of peak you can't take your eye of screen, the biggest from movie is that they can't keep audience hook for 2 hour but Sandeep Reddy vanga's Animal is beautiful canvas of Art. Art of cinema every aspect of movie do there work passionately either it's cinematography, theme, background score or songs , acting was at other level not just the lead but entire cast play sincerely they role the climax make your brain blow.Cinematography was good, lighting of fighting scene give peace to screenplay

2,"Burtal, Glore and just bad","I am really disappointed and shocked by the movie. Despite the trailers being enticing, I anticipated a strong comeback from Ranbir Kapoor. While his acting is commendable, the overall execution of the movie, including its story and plot, was excessively barbaric and brutal in nature.The film, regrettably, contains scenes that render it unsuitable for family viewing. The portrayal of women's cruelty and the depiction of individuals with unstable minds contribute to the movie's unsettling nature, detracting from its cinematic essence.It is imperative to caution against viewing this film with one's family. Ranbir Kapoor, an inherently gifted actor, elevates his performance to an unparalleled level with intense dedication to his role. However, the question arises as to whether he should engage in projects that seemingly forsake humane values. Despite acclaim at the box office, the movie's reception on OTT platforms appears less favorable.Bobby Deol's role, though brief, portrays another manic character. While initial interest may be piqued by a song teaser, subsequent exposure left me disgusted. Furthermore, the movie is replete with senseless action, heavily drawing inspiration from other films, notably a scene from Maula Jatt.In summary, the viewing experience leaves a bad sense of discontent and a bitter taste in your mind.Not at all worth seeing.",negative
6,A movie with great potential ruined by bad editing and misogyny,"A movie with great potential ruined by bad direction, editing, dialogue delivery and misogyny. For the first few minutes, the movie seems like a typical Arjun Reddy!/Kabir Singh kinda movie. Later when the pace picks off, the movie is ruined by extended action scenes and bad editing. Even the camerawork during the action scenes isn't great and the movie is desperately in need of subtitles as most of Ranbir and Rashmika's dialogues are not audible. There are unnecessary references to women having periods again for the second time after Arjun Reddy. Seems like the director has some issues with women and finds to necessary to comment on these topics. Again the hero is a selfish guy that doesn't care about anyone else but only his ego. Not gonna give any spoilers. Although the post credit climax is unpredictable and amazing but the movie is ruined by having songs in the wrong place and certain scenes being stretched out. Also some of the movie post the first half is boring. Also if you're here for Bobby Deol then you will be disappointed as he hardly has a screentime of 5-10 minutes at the most. All in all only watch this movie to be disappointed. You can maybe watch it on ott but definitely not worth going to the theatre for. Also Sandeep Reddy Vanga it's not cool to demean women again and again and showing males as an alpha isn't really necessary. Learn to respect women. 6/10.",negative
6,Ranbir Kapoor Aces as Ranvijay Singh In This Toxic Crime Drama !!!,"Having craved for his rich father's (Anil Kapoor) love and attention all his life, an unhinged Vijay (Ranbir Kapoor) gets obsessive and violent when his dad is attacked. Seeking revenge and hunting down the conspirators become his only aim. Picture Godfather on steroids, devoid of its psychological tension.Blood is thicker than water according to the film's protagonist. The safety and unity of family is sacrosanct no matter how twisted the relations. We are even led to believe that dysfunctional is better than broken.Through an exhausting runtime of 3 hours, 21 minutes, comprising extreme bloodshed, testosterone and blatant misogyny, writer-director Sandeep Reddy Vanga, known for his controversial statements and thoughts, glorifies the alpha male once again through his Godfather-esque tale.When his father is shot, Vijay declares himself as the 'man of the house' and takes matters into his own hands. He assures his father that he'll safeguard their steel empire and family's legacy but revenge first.Despite anger and daddy issues, he has an active love life. He seduces Geetanjali (Rashmika Mandanna), through his toxic macho traits and erratic, inappropriate humour. ""Don't call me bhaiyya. I don't have brotherly feelings for you."" He compliments her childbearing hips and like Christian Grey, whisks her away in his private jet for some high-altitude dom/sub love making. ""You were the bottom, you didn't have to do much"", he comments after. He even expects her to forgive his infidelity because she forgives his other crimes anyway. ""Aap log mahinay ke chaar din pad badalne par bolte ho, main din mein chaar baar pad badal raha hu"", he argues post an injury, questioning women's right to complain about period pain.Pop culture has often glorified bad boys. There's always something attractive about people who refuse to toe the line. Vanga takes this romanticisation a bit too far. Even as his take on women and violence unsettle you immensely as a viewer, those are his preferences for a protagonist as a director, and he is free to have them. The bigger issue is the lack of purpose in the story. His gun-wielding angry young man comes across as a rebel without a cause.Cocky, broken, and problematic characters can be celebrated if they have a reason strong enough to explain the mayhem, if not justify. Vijay has none and in the absence of it, Animal ends up as all swag and no substance derailed family drama. What is fuelling his fire and the rage within? The father-son discord that forms the crux of the story itself stays unexplored. Barring Ranbir, the story barely invests in other characters, turning them into silent spectators, including the very talented Anil Kapoor and Bobby Deol. AK is excellent in the confrontational scenes and Bobby looks menacing, but both have very little to do. Women are submissive puppets. Mandanna's Hindi dialogues are harder to comprehend than the film's intention.'Animal' relies heavily on Ranbir Kapoor's talent and stardom. His raw sex appeal and unmatched intensity are the film's highlights. One of the finest actors of this generation, you find yourself trapped in his troubled mind as his blood-soaked eyes seethe with rage. Uninhibited, his ability to become the character he plays, shocks, stuns, and draws you in each frame. RK lends that dangerously unpredictable quality to this deranged character and aces it especially in that Vaastav-like crucial climax scene. He deserved a better script to match this level of performance.Ranbir Kapoor can be Joaquin Phoenix but Animal's no Joker. This entire film could have just been a conversation between the father and his son.",negative

Movie 1st 1hour is so good and excites you but after that there is no story in movie its look like they just have to complete the movie duration so they added different character frequently in movie and change the movie message that we are going for and that they show us in first half of the movie.,negative
7,That one for HardCore Violence Lovers!,"Soon after getting released in the theaters, I went for this movie because of it's powerful casting, direction, music and of course promotions of social media platforms. After coming back from theatre I searched for various critics as well as public opinions regarding this movie and surprisingly it came up with a mix response from both sides. But again I waited for it's OTT release just because I heard that it will come up with additional 15-20min from the theatrical version, but disappointed by the latest norms over Movie to OTT. So I haven't went for it once again because this movie is kind of One time Watch for me and I'm not gonna spend my 3hr20min again for this movie.The plot is basic and simple but not in chronological order, so you have to pay attention to it's timeline.. The best part of this movie is of course Ranbir Kapoor's ACTING along with 15min but important cameo of Bobby Deol, that one Top Notch for sure! The Music.. wow.. I just Fallin Luv with it especially the way they designed and plotted Arjan Vailly song.. The Cinematography is extremely good and of course the direction is also superb.. The Negative point about this movie is - it's quite illogical action revenge kind of story just emphasizes on pure violence, s*x, male dominance, no consequences of open murders and so on.. Story could have been little bit more realistic, but again it's a mass entertainer so I can digest that.Overall movie is pretty much lengthy but extremely gripping in the 1st half, in the 2nd half its loose it's shape a little bit and soon after the entry of Lord Bobby again it's fast paced and gripping. Definitely a pure adult genre movie and not recommend at all to watch with family . And I will go with 7 Out of 10 Stars for it..And in the end.... Don't miss the climax and post credit scene... I will wait for gruesome Animal Park for sure!!!",positive
10,We don't deserve such movies!,"If made in Hollywood by Tarantino, people would have gone gaga about this movie. But Indian audience is just focus on one aspect.. treatment of women.C'mon we all know this guy is just sick, his actions are not of a normal person (Hence, Animal) and I personally do not support this, but this guy is not me.Yes the movie is bit lengthy, could have been 30 mins shorter. The entire movie is super intense and keeps you engeged.I believe, directors vision was to show the extreme dark side of the main chracter, and i believe he was exteremaly successful in the same. You can feel it by people's strong reactions to this movie.Wonderful acting by Ranbeer and Rashmika, Tripti got fame because of the intimate scenes but her acting was sub par.Anil Kapoor's talent was absent from the movie as his cheacter was from his son's life.Bobby Deol, short, punchy and brilliant.This was truly a Sandeep Reddy Vanga movie and hats off to him to create and visualize something like this.I am sure people bashing this movie will find Indian classics from 60s and 70s more misogynistic than this movie and yet we enjoy those with our familes.",positive
8,"Ranbir Kapoor preaches dominance in this wild, unhinged & blood soaked rampage of an obsessed son with umpteen shades of gray","Animal is an unapologetic display of cinematic brilliance which by far will be the most polarising film of the year. Witnessed absolute carnage when the insanely choreographed interval block comes. Worth your money. Vanga's book of filmaking is certainly defies Indian School of filmaking as it breaks all stereotypes and challenges the critics with a more wierd and lunatic approach. A father son bond carved in blood, an obsessed son seeking the only validation from his father, power hungry dynamics within the family and conflicting relationship of the protagonist with his wife serves the core of the film. In short, Ranbir embodies the character by heart and delivers a riveting performance for film schools to make a case study of. Sandeep Reddy Vanga restablishes himself as director who defies all odds and keeps no stone unturned when he adds the grays to his lead characters. While the film shines because of the leading man Ranbir, exceptional music and the 2 stylishly choreographed action set pieces and obviously the meticulously written dialogues. What's dissapointing is the underdeveloped antagonists and a stretched husband wife dynamic which stretches a tad too long.PerformancesWhen Vanga said this is what violence means, we never expected this much mayhem. Ranbir Kapoor has outshined every other actor in the fraternity with this haunting and consumed characterisation. His dialogues, multiple looks and rage is a force to reckon with. Rashmika however trolled she might have been , she is quite formidable in scenes she had to deliver. There is a serious problem in her Hindi diction which may have affected her performance a bit. Anil Kapoor exceptional as he also presents vulnerability and disagreements when required. The heartbreaking fact is the Lord Bobby is criminally given less screen time and that will be debated by everyone. His screen presence is just terrorizing for the spectators. Missed Opportunity. Tripti Dimri is magical onscreen. Wished she was Bhabhi no.1.Music and Background ScoreThe music is given by Vishal Mishra and Manan Bharadwaj. They have literally given gems as songs and the integration of the songs is extremely surreal. Credita to Vanga , being a Telugu speaking Director has got this on point. Be that a hardcore Arjan Vailly during the Interval block, a mesmerizing Hua Main , a resonating Papa Meri Jaan or the love song of the year Pehle Bhi Main. Each song and beats during the dramatic turn of events is magical and adds a crucial part of the screenplay.Questionable Glorification of A CriminalIn Vanga's world , ethics and morality have always been the backbenchers. He writes obsessive characters whether its Kabir for Preeti or Vijay for Balbir, there is no right or wrong. While the obsession to safeguard his father is justifiable to some extent, the dominating and edgy dynamics between Ranbir and Rashmika is something not easily digestible. There is a sense of wierdness which Vanga loves to introduce which is voluntary. He knows moments which will trigger critics, audiences and help create more buzz and debates which eventually helps in box office footfalls. Vanga is a smart man. The writing is brilliant except some underused chacaters, while many may not share the same feeling as me , the dynamics of power leading to all the chaos is rightfully justified.Watch or Not?The film is a ticking time bomb, which has everything you have not expected from a Bollywood film. Breaks every stereotype unabashedly courtesy Vanga Sir. If you are a person who gets easily triggered, or has set standards how far a film's scenes are limited to, have allergies seeing bloodshed then stay away from this. If you are a Vanga fan, Ranbir Fan or a fan of unique storytelling without getting influenced then Animal deserves your time. Our country is filled with emotionally weak individuals and cinema has a lot of influence. The tone of the sexism should always be in check when you cater to such large emotional audience. I am afraid if people will draw inspiration from Ranbir's character instead of just watching it for entertainment. That will be a loss for Indian Cinema.

6,"It's poison. But, may be we were already poisonous?","The flaws of the film are quite clear. The director isn't even making an effort to hide them. He embraces them. A few minutes into, you understand that there is going to be a lot of nonsense. And that gives the director a lot of freedom. He doesn't explain anyone's actions. No format. No coherent storytelling. An hour into, things start making sense relatively and gradually get better. In parts, the movie runs conversations in Telugu, Panjabi and Marathi with no subtitles. That's how carefree the director is. That's something to appreciate.The protagonist is not a hero but instead a villain. The title clarifies it enough, but we can't. Maybe we should change our expectations from the formulaic format. Whatever! The movie was exciting, and the success speaks about it. It is one of those films where we change our opinions. We might have felt leaving the theatre but don't be surprised if we end up watching it again. It's poison. But maybe we were already poisonous?",negative
5,Animal was not up to the mark movie,"Ranbir Kapoor looks very good in this called animal. The best surprising actor was Sachdeva who played the brother of Boby deol. He must be praised for his acting Anil Kapoor looks good in the movie. The most beautiful Rashmika Mandanna looks very very beautiful. In this movie chemistry between Ranbir and Rashmika looks really good. Movie pace is very very fast, if you look at your mobile for five minute during the movie you cannot catch the movie again. Overall I found the movie is okay. Okay not very very good. The hype for the movie was made very very high. I can give only five star to this movie because it is only that.",negative
4,A huge step down for SRV,"ANIMAL's runtime, as stated by the CBFC certificate, is 3 hours and 23 minutes, and I kid you not, I wasn't invested in the film even for 23 minutes. The story is so predictable that even a kid could guess what's going to happen next, and it's stretched so much because of unnecessary fillers completely irrelevant to the plot, that after a while the film becomes an endurance test. Seriously, you can chop half of the scenes, and the film would still be the same. The story jumps back and forth multiple times, and the transitions feel so jarring that you really wonder whether truly SRV directed this film or not.This film is vulgar, crass and problematic, but I can forgive all that, not because I am some misogynistic alpha psycho, but because it's a story of a deeply flawed character and the story is told from his POV. Even looking through this angle, the film becomes tough to watch in various moments where the writing reeks of toxic masculinity and women are treated with utter disrespect, and as mere objects meant to be acquired or disrespected, without much authority over themselves. (And then you realise that you are watching an SRV film and that's how women exist in his films.) It's not the obligation of any film to educate the masses or give them moral lessons. If you're imparting some good message through your films, then good, but it's not the duty of any art. That's why I am not going to comment on the social implications of the problematic things shown in the film, as the audience is smart enough to differentiate between reel and real. Also for god's sake, it's an A rated film, what're you expecting, a Disney musical? But what I can't forgive in this film is how boring it is. Not going to lie, this film gave me a headache, purely because of how little happens in the film and how unnecessarily long it is. The film sells you a narrative about the emotional conflict between a father and his son, and that's the driving force of the plot. But the core issue is never aptly explored, and was resolved in a laughably bad manner. Utterly underwhelming!",negative
10,One of the best Bollywood movie,"""Animal is a cinematic gem with Ranbir Kapoor delivering his career's finest performance. The background music and songs create a wonderful atmosphere, enhancing the overall experience. The movie is not just a hit; it's a blockbuster, thanks to the brilliant performances from the entire cast. Under Sandeep Reddy Vanga's top-notch direction, Animal stands out as one of Bollywood's best offerings, weaving a compelling narrative that captivates from beginning to end. Kapoor's stellar acting, coupled with a captivating soundtrack, elevates it to a league of its own. The ensemble cast's brilliant job adds depth to the storyline, making Animal a memorable and top-tier Bollywood movie.""",positive
9,Loved it,"""Animal"" ventures into uncharted territory for Bollywood, embracing a Tarantino-esque style with a distinct desi flair. The film unfolds with a pulsating energy, reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino's signature vibe, yet uniquely embedded in Indian cinema. While the storyline may not be groundbreaking, the movie compensates with stellar performances from its cast. Shakti Kapoor's return adds nostalgic charm, and the eccentricity of the main character injects a refreshing dynamism.The film's true standout is its cinematography, skillfully capturing the essence of each scene. From intense confrontations to laid-back moments, the visuals create a compelling atmosphere. Despite a somewhat lackluster narrative, the movie's entertainment factor is undeniable. If you're a Tarantino enthusiast, the desi twist might be a delightful surprise. The actors' commendable portrayals elevate the viewing experience, making it a must-watch for those appreciating strong performances.While ""Animal"" may not appeal to everyone due to its unconventional style and narrative shortcomings, its strengths lie in the execution. The fusion of Bollywood and Tarantino influences might be an acquired taste, but for those willing to embrace the blend, it promises an engaging cinematic experience. In my opinion, the film's unique approach, commendable acting, and striking cinematography make it a worthwhile addition to your watchlist.",positive
1,Complete waste of time and money,"Movie is not even worth writing a review. Completely unreal and utter rubbish. Not even a single thing was worth reviewing or watching. Violence was beyond imagination. Out of this world sex scenes like honeymoon on a plane with autopilot was a complete failure. All in all, total failure. If you want to waste your time and money you are more then welcome to go and watch it. There is only a one liner story which is revenge and to stretch that, you were tied up to watch a 3 odd hour movie. I wish there was a fast forward button in cinema. Avoid at all cost. If have to watch at gunpoint, watch at home.",negative
7,Vanga Monsterclass,"I was in 2 minds on whether to watch it Animal in the theatres. While the teaser was exciting, (especially Bobby Deol's bit), the trailer kind of seemed to reveal way too much about what the movie would be about. The plot seemed very basic from whatever that we could see in the trailer. I was not really a big fan of the movie Arjun Reddy despite some raw filmmaking. I waited a few days for some reviews and of course the movie has collected a lot of polarizing opinions. But I decided to go and check what the hype is all about anyway, plus I was really curious to see Bobby Deol's maniac role.The movie is self-centered around Ranbir's character and while I was about to mention the name here, I am taking it back. One has to just see it themselves the way that is revealed in the movie. The character name reveal is a genius move and you really got to give credit to the dialogue writing up until that point to keep the lines in such a way that they do not need to reveal the name. The initial few minutes of the movie kind of look like Sanju and plays like a biopic. There is also a bit of non-linear screenplay before the interval just to build the suspense up. Then comes a long and expected interval block with a noisy action sequence. Despite it being way too over the top, Sandeep Reddy Vanga makes it an entertaining watch. Post-interval, the movie kind of takes a pause to explore Ranbir's family dynamics which kind of feels a little too much. Post Bobby Deol's character introduction, the movie picks up the pace and adds sub plots before reaching the climax. Majority of the reviews and opinions called out the second half being a letdown, while I feel some parts of it did, the climax made up to it. The Climax Fight is a treat to watch with a very interesting song selection and of course the monstrous performances of Bobby and Ranbir.Animal's strength is in its unconventional, over the top, loud and unapologetic narration. Sandeep Reddy Vanga has definitely walked on a very thin ice and has successfully taken this risk. He has been greatly supported by his actors and different music directors. This movie could almost be just another revenge saga if not for its narration and the way it explores different relationships. While the promotion is about the movie exploring father-son relationships, I personally feel it is more than that. I feel that the husband-and-wife relationships and conflicts between the leading pair offer more than the father-son relationship which is in a way is supposed to be the main plot.Ranbir Kapoor devours the character like an animal he is. He shows again the different shades that he can bring which we saw in Sanju but in a more raw and maniacal way. Rashmika Mandanna has put in a strong performance as well but at times her switch of Hindi accents is noticeable. I personally feel that Anil Kapoor's character isn't as strong as it should be. It is definitely Lord Bobby Deol who walks away with one of the best antagonist performances of 2023 despite having very little screentime for a movie which is quite long. His character could have been explored better. Tripti Dimri shines both physically 😉 and emotionally in her small role. Special mention to Saurabh Sachdeva who suits a very cunning and evil character. Also, the actors in the Punjabi brotherhood add to some of the lighter and heavier (in terms of action) moments in the movie but at times their characters feel a bit too overcooked.Animal is one of the daring experiments in terms of filmmaking despite having a thin plot. It is definitely not for everyone. The movie makes you laugh, laughs with you and at times even laughs at you. Sandeep Reddy Vanga definitely delivers on his promise on the violet film in a very unconventional way.",positive
2,"""ANIMAL"": More Marketing Hype Than Movie Magic","Critical Review of ANIMAL
While the film ""ANIMAL"" has garnered significant box office success, it's crucial to critically examine its merits and flaws. Here's a breakdown of your concerns:
Unrealistic Narrative:
The film deviates significantly from real-world scenarios, portraying a world devoid of law and order. This lack of grounding makes the narrative feel implausible and even exploitative.The time shifts within the film are poorly executed, further confusing the audience and hindering their engagement with the story.A character with a heart condition miraculously recovers and engages in strenuous activity, defying all medical logic and stretching audience credulity.Marketing Hype:
The film's marketing campaign, heavily reliant on social media, appears manipulative and excessive. This fabricated hype creates a false sense of popularity and fails to accurately reflect the film's quality.The marketing team misrepresents the film's genre, blurring the lines between action and drama and misleading viewers about the intended experience.Directorial Choices:
The director's attempt to portray criminality through the trailer and teaser creates an expectation of a gritty and realistic film. However, the actual execution falls short, leaving the audience dissatisfied.The film's portrayal of father-son relationships lacks depth and emotional resonance, failing to connect with viewers on a deeper level.Overall Impression:
Despite its box office success, ""ANIMAL"" fails to deliver on its promise. The unrealistic narrative, misleading marketing campaign, and questionable directorial choices create a film that is ultimately unsatisfying and forgettable.Additional Points:
The film's violence may be gratuitous and disturbing to certain viewers.The portrayal of women in the film can be seen as sexist and objectifying.The film lacks originality and feels derivative of other gangster films.It's important to note that critical reviews are subjective and reflect individual perspectives. While the film may not resonate with you, it may appeal to others. However, it's crucial to engage in critical analysis to identify the film's strengths and weaknesses, ultimately fostering a more informed understanding of cinema.""ANIMAL"": More Marketing Hype Than Movie Magic.",negative
5,Good in parts not whole,"Animal as a whole is a tiresome watch especially the second half is dragged unnecessarily. The main lead can do anything like taking gun to school, killing person openly in a packed conference without any police action. The action scenes are just good but the one with big machine is very lengthy. It's dragged with unwanted jokes on undies and song. 1 man fights with an entire army of people with an axe whereas his bodyguards sing song without doing anything.The second half is lengthy with unwanted scenes, lame jokes which does not add anything to the movie. The main villian is just hardly for 20 mins. The climax was good but villians bodyguard are killed easily in their home without any fight. It's ends with 1-1 fight with song and bodyguards just watching like usual. End credit scene was bloody good.",negative
1,Third Class Movie,"I can't believe there are people who write such scripts, actors who act this and people who like to watch it. Sadly we live in a sick world. Vomit inducing dialogues, actions and thought process. It feels like it has been written by an angry horny high-school boy. People who gleefully enjoyed this movie I wonder if you'd be so happy if this treatment happens to your mom or sister. No redeeming qualities in the movie whatsoever. No coherent storyline, sentimental music is being played in all the wrong places and when the main character is doing vile things. A hindi serial is less nonsensical than the second half of the movie. Waste of time, money, mental energy...3 and half hours of my life I will never get back.",negative
1,"Baseless story, No Logic",Got a headache after watching this movie. No logical binding of scenes. Need atleast 5 Hrs of meditation to detox effect of this movie.A team of villainb goons comes with gun and then second team with axe and another team with rifels or whatever. Couldn't able to understand if they have such advance weapons why they come with axe to fight. Funny thing is when a team of 100 villain goons fighting with axe Ranbir's team guys holding gun in hand are singing a Punjabi song 😂😂😂 they would have easily killed axe gang with guns.Bobby has the best dialogues in movie 😂 I saw people leaving movie in mid half.,negative
5,Not Animal enough in the first half,"I don't understand all the people complaining about the movie being misogynistic. I think the director made it clear that name of the movie was ""Animal"" and. Not ""Pussy Cat"", I would have been surprised if the Animal did not behave like an Animal. That being said, I felt the first half was not Animal enough and was too cheesy and corny and they could have avoided that. The second half lives up to its name and gets help from the arrival of the Villain who is also Animal like. I wish the first half was made with more heart. The end part were the sequel is teased is a big give away and it's clear who survives in that. I wish the director did not make it so obvious.",negative
8,Animal,"There is this character of Ranbir Kapoor, who appeared as an old man in the first scene. The year mentioned was 2056. Then we see him getting severely injured almost multiple times - literally requiring an heart transplantation to survive and also goes deaf. He still manages to survive at least till his 70s. We still don't know what he is yet to go through in the sequel Animal park. In fact, it was surprising how he managed to stay alive throughout the movie. The kind of a character he was, it wouldn't have been surprising had he gone through numerous assassination attempts time and again. His fighting style though was never explained. What kind of skills he possessed. From where did he learn them. What makes him easily handle dozens of men at a time. Those men, the henchmen of the antagonists would certainly be trained fighters.This is a masala entertainer and you won't be bored watching this movie despite it being 3 and the half hours long. The movie as a whole seems to have paid tribute to the Sikh empire who fought against the Afghans and also paid homage to the Maratha empire for a brief period.",positive
6,Mindless movie-Awesome Ranbir!,"Same mysogynistic saga that Venga displayed in his first venture. Alpha male, really??? Are we living in the days of hunter-gatherers or what??? Nonsense. Too violent and too illogical. If it wasnt for Ranbir, Id have given it a rating of 2 or 3. Ranbir is absolutely brilliant. His intensity just blows your mind away. When you think he has reached perfection, he delivers something that is even a notch higher than before. Must watch one time or may be two, just for Ranbir's out of the world performance. He has nailed it. None else could have make me watch this mindless slaughter hunt for 3.5hrs.",negative
1,"Don't go, Violence, Negativity, No Storyline... Just unnecessary time waste movie","I regret to say that the Animal movie failed to impress due to its excessive and unnecessary violence, lackluster dialogue, illogical monologues that added little to the plot, and an emphasis on sexual terms and activity that overshadowed any meaningful storytelling. Furthermore, depicting the Alpha male as a womanizer rather than a character with depth or purpose was disappointing and reinforced outdated stereotypes. Overall, this movie's focus on such aspects detracted from any potential enjoyment and left a sour viewing experience. They haven't used the Sikhs and even the word Papa... used like hell.",negative
9,"Sandeep Reddy Vanga saying once again ""I don't care""",Sandeep Reddy Vanga makes the movie he wants to make. Period. He is really lucky to be getting to do what he really wants to do without needing to pander to anyone and especially to critics or award seeking. I wish he keeps to get to do what he wants.I don't have any opinion of the movie neither good nor bad but I was absolutely fascinated exhilarated by what I saw. It turned all my expectations upside down and at the end of it all I definitely felt I watched something fresh new and never before seen.The movie will make you divided and uncomfortable but like me if you want to witness the art of cinema in different forms and not just award and critics approval seeking or mass money seeking then you will have your wish granted.,positive
10,This is the best movie ever made in Bollywood.,"Perfect Direction, Brilliant Father son story, Great acting, Phenomenal movie..

Love should be in between mother and father rather than girlfriend wife.To summarise i would say and appeal to continue making these type of movies that show love between mother and father.",positive
3,Only BGM and looks. Hardly any story. SVR needs to work on story as well,"I wish the movie was as good as the trailer.Did advance booking with high hopes and excitement all because of the exceptional trailer but turned out to be a waste of time. There was not much shown between a father and son .The 1st half was still ok , but the 2nd half was a total waste of time. It deviates from the plot as if the Indian audience is fool and will consume whatever is being shown. Bobby Deol's intense presence was hardly 25 mins. Why ?SVR needs to rethink about the story as well.Only BGM and intense looks is not required in a movie. Please. Thanks for Arjan Valey song though.",negative
7,Overall a good movie,"The movie could have been shorter, and was at times a little to overdramatized. Main action scene was a little long, But it was a fun ride. It was quite good, and the performances was:Ranbir was awesome 🔥
Anil was great
Bobby was okey- I don't get all the hype. He looked good and was menacing but his screen time was beraly enough too live up too the hype.The Sikh cousins did a good job.Villains was good with what they had.The father & son angle was just great and so well acted in every scene by both. The mean animal character was just straight out cool, Bollywood has never shown us a movie or character this self destructive before.The main girl was the biggest minus
I can't bear her face nor acting. She has no talent and even the looks to back it up. And putting her in front of someone like Ranbir is a tuff one.But well everyone else did well.",positive

7,"Animal will have polarising views but, it's fresh and unique which is why the audiences are loving it.","Animal is brilliant but needs a team of psychiatrists to cure him.We've all read thoughts on Toxic Masculinity and Misogyny in many of the write ups about this movie. Those thoughts stay. I don't have any new perspective to add. So let's talk about what the audience could be vibing about this movie making it such a big blockbuster.The best part about Sandeep Reddy Vanga's story telling is he opens every scene with a surprise. He leads you into thinking of what's going to happen and takes you completely into a different space than what one could've thought about. He does this throughout the movie, with ease.Everything from the story line, music, action sequences, performances are brilliantly planned and executed. The relationship between father and son is beautiful and the climax makes up for all its faults.This can be counted at Ranbir Kapoor's best performance yet. He tears open the screen with his brilliance and ease, transforming from angry teenager to animal man. This role catapults him to the best Hindi cinema actor we have currently. Rashmika sounds like she's speaking with supari in her mouth. Anil Kapoor handles his role with stature and maturity. Bobby Deol delivers a career best performance in a role that's given him a very short screen presence.Strictly for 18+ viewing. The adult scenes are forced and seem unnatural. The Alpha male kicks in with no worthy social message. Also wish some uncomfortable scenes were edited.Addressing the question of logic, it can be acknowledged that this film, like many others, is inherently illogical.Animal will have polarising views but, it's fresh and unique which is why the audiences are loving it. Also, it's aesthetically appealing and enjoyable.Purely for theatrical viewing, may not be enjoyable at home, or worse, on the mobile.",positive

alpha son. Fatally in love with his father. Sometimes thrashed. Sometimes thrasher.The alpha male needs no introduction. He was, is and perhaps will be, reinvented to suit boot the times. Sometimes as an avatar, mostly as an animal.In the free fall jungle of a world. What will you do:
if your freedom is in danger?If you crave for some kind of love from your father, while you are devastatingly in love with him?If your sister is abused in the name of ragging?If the same sister is then married to be a door mat?If your father survives an assassination attack by an unknown enemy?The correct answers are delivered by ranvijay balbir aka ranbir kapoor aka animal.What happens in close encounters of the fatal kind is happening in the highly criticised, rarely praised film of the moment.If protecting your freedom and family by blood or by extension in an anarchy environment. Loving them madly. Be misogynistic. So be it.Yes in some frames women are abused. Given the situation, if you were in the protagonist/antagonist's shoes? Maybe you would do worse than make her lick yours, shoes i mean.Animal is dark cinema at its best. Boldly carried on ranbir's animal act. Being compared to cult films like silence of the lambs, kill bill and other tarantino epics of blood, gore and violence. Even if it is to show the film down, is but hidden praise.

Their main focus was to show love for his father, they completely failed in that. No where it felt 'ki yes he has that kida of love for his father' they completely failed in this.Movie makers also tried to show his character wild and cool, but usme bhi failed, it never felt like ki he has that Kabir Singh's actor(Shahid Kapoor) wala or close to wild or cool role, who didn't give a damn to anyone against his need and love.Makers also failed in showing love for his wife as well, nothing was proper all rubbish.Only thing I liked was Bobydeol role, how it started, but again they ended it abruptly and within 20mins.Really very very disappointed.Don't watch in cinema hall, only on phone and that also in 240p.",negative

7,Works partly doesnt work partly for me!,"Finally watched the most talked about film of current month,the blockbuster ANIMAL. The film has placed ""Superstar"" Ranbir Kapoors film career right on top at Bollywood after few not so great years. The film inspite of being huge success has got extreme reactions and ignited debates from critics and film buffs alike due to exaggerated depiction. I will try to pen down my honest unbiased though lengthy opinion on this violent film by Sandeep Reddy Vanga.The film is about an extremely aggressive young guy Ran Vijay Singh ( Ranbir Kapoor) who is overtly possessive about his extremely rich and busy father (Anil Kapoor). Ranvijay gets into one trouble after other and his relationships with wife,sisters and everyone is always on extremes.When the father is attacked, the son becomes literally an ""ANIMAL"" to revenge.The topic of father and son relationship and issues has been integral to Hindi cinema from the time of Mughal E Azam. The genre reached peak with Amitabh bachchan and Salim Javed combination films most noticeably Trishul and Shakti. However,Animal doesn't have any of that as core issue. Its the story of a neglected son by his super busy father and has overtones to Bobby(where son was Ranbeers great dad Rishi) and Sharaabi(Amitabh and Pran). The film has shades of Copolas classic Godfather and it's Desi remake Dharmatma as well. Ranbirs character has madness like SRK(Darr,Anjaam), trouble maker hero Salmans (Tere Naam) and Vanga adds his Kabir Singh male toxicity in full thrust here. There are also shades of Ranbirs earlier big hits like Raajneeti and Rockstar, yet overall the character is totally different from all these.Of the performances I found Anil Kapoors character and performance both very weak. Inspite of long length of role, he somehow didn't get enough lines to emote well and whatever he did was average. The golden old time baddies Prem Chopra and Shakti Kapoor have small but effective positive roles. Suresh Oberoi, after Vangas' Kabir Singh is again good here. Bobby Deol as the violent villain surprisingly gets very less screen time and it's more of a glorified cameo. Though the role's duration disappoints, yet Bobby Deol doesn't and has got a resurrection of sorts. Tripti Domra has more skin show than dialogues ,which added to her popularity. The female lead Rashmika disappoints a lot and her performance is not at all effective.Sandeep Vangas pack a punch in the emotional scenes ,but also shows over male toxity with too much uneccesary emphasis on ""Alpha"" male. Some sequences seems forced in for the heck of making the film disturbing and bold. They could have easily been edited out reducing the longgg length of film. The screenplay also has many lose ends. The first half is gripping but in second half pace drops at several places. The action is brutal ,very well shot but the violence is on extreme. The music and songs are great and the track ""Arjun Vailly"" is excellent and it's reference to Sikh History battle makes it haunting!!! The background score is killer!!The film belongs to one person -Ranbirrrrr and the Kapoor Khandaan's son nails it. Though post ""SANJU"" his mannerisms here reminds one of Sanjay Dutt of 1990s-Yalgaar,Khalnayak and Vaastav lot,yet he shows his own class. From a school student till an old man,he is great in all shades. He plays both the Rebel with a cause and also Rebel WITHOUT a Cause effectively! The film gives a hint for it's sequel as well!!Overall I liked the film basically for Ranbir Kapoor,strong songs and powerful fights. However,owing to a lot of forced scenes which makes film toxic as well,and longg length, I can't say that I Loved it!!",positive
10,"What a master piece, don't even rember last great hit from Bollywood","This is the best movie in Decades bollywood has generated. Excellent performance from Ranbir and Bobby. Great work on casting. Every character in the movie is prefect cast. Nobody else than these actors can justify their roles. Sandeep did it so well. I hear people talking about violence and guns, but there is nothing as such in the movie. Ofcouse its not for kids and children. What a great message delivered in the movie about families. When in need, you can trust only family when nobody else if faithful. I been to the movie twice, theater full of ppl and waiting for another round in theater, hope movie is still in USA theater by then. I think bad reviews are either by ppl who do not understand the quality or just hakla gang fan clubs.",positive
5,Macabre and gratuitous in violence,"SRV has made a technically brilliant film imo, but he has let loose violence and macabre in favor of solid story telling which could have restricted the movie to a 150 mins instead of the 200+ or so running time.I miss movies from Sriram Raghavan who in similar dark themes created Badlapur without the need for extreme gore.Having said that as much as I am disappointed by recent releases, Animal and The Archies, its a time to celebrate the diversity of content.I keep faith in that series like The Railway Men can still produce nail biting content without being excessive with drama or violence.",negative
9,"Absolutely mad movies. People who love cinema, please watch this","What an experience man, what a writing. Anyone who wants to watch this movie, KEEP an open mind and understand the meaning behind all controversial portrayals. Because this movie is a cinematic masterpiece. Very little technical flaws. This movie portrays so many ideas and themes that work so well with what the director intends, and the emotions... wow, emotions just work absolutely so bloody well. It's extremely violent and blunt, both visually and verbally so people who can't take violence... this is definitely not the movie for you.. this movie is 3 and half hours and I dont feel a single lag. It's extremely fast-paced which is amazing. Every single scene keeps you hooked on. Ranbir Kapoor's acting was just pure greatness and the music of the film... absolutely gorgeous... the direction, the writing... absolutely amazing... If people thought Arjun Reddy was controversial... Animal will show what controversy is...",positive
6,"Ranbir Kapoor Unleashes Action-packed Avatar, Emerges as Bollywood's New Action Hero!","SRV keeps his promise by creating a more violent film than ""Arjun Reddy"" and ""Kabir Singh."" ""Animal"" boasts an ensemble cast including Ranbir Kapoor, Anil Kapoor, Rashmika, Bobby Deol, Tripti Dimri, and veteran actors like Prem Chopra, Sunil Oberoi, and Shakti Kapoor. Essentially, it relies on an outdated storyline lifted by extraordinary execution, offering nothing new besides some new tropes. Ranbir Kapoor shines and owns his character, while the rest of the cast does a commendable job. The screenplay is lucid, keeping you engaged throughout the lengthy 3 hours and 21 minutes. The songs are okay, but the thumping BGM elevates important scenes. Some scenes are quite disturbing, but it's important to understand that this is a movie, and the characters are flawed. In the era of fast-paced lifestyles, holding the audience's attention for over 3 hours is no small feat. Overall, it's an enjoyable affair if you don't expect too much, but this movie is not for everyone. After SRK, RK has emerged as an action star this year. Don't miss this one if you are an ardent RK fan.",negative
1,An example of ingredients packed recipe getting wasted due to quality,"Even if we keep the full misogyny packed delivery aside, I don't see any storyline. Only a tedious long pretentious slasher episode without any plot or adequate goal or even any good climax.We've plenty of larger than life heroes in previous with whom we can connect, have adrenaline rush seeing their appearances, with their defeats-sorrows-resurrections. Here, we failed to connect with the hero. The movie has failed to left any impact on the audience let alone positive or negative and has become a poor piece of entertainment. A perfect example of how a bunch of good casts and their cumulative efforts can go in vain to a plan less plot.A valid questions has been raised about director's perspective on women's rights, position in society and their sexualities.",negative
9,Worth watching in the theatre,"Animal Movie is worth watching, don't go by what's written on social media. I read somewhere that don't watch it with your GF or wife, I myself watched it with my wife and after the movie I am still married. Cast - The main charm of the movie for me was the cast and music. Apart from Rashmika, everybody played their role perfectly. Ranbir for me was outstanding followed up with Anil Kapoor and Bobby Deol. Thankgod Bollywood finally learnt to showcase Punjabis properly and with the right form of turban/beard. The Punjabi cousins of Ranbir in the movie are actually looking like Punjabis.Music - Music is just top notch, I would recommend watching in theatre otherwise if you are watching it at home watch it with sound bar or headphones. You will be surprised to see the placement of B praak song in the movie. Only Vanga can think of these kinds of things. Plot - There is no super suspense in the movie, It's just moments in the movie which builds up the whole thing. The serious conversations b/w Anil Kapoor and Ranbir are the standouts for me.8.5/10 for me.",positive
2,"Trash & baseless,only for music i added one more star","Unesessory scenes added where no connections between scenes,.. Unnecessary song's, inn some scenes he have respect towards women, in other scenes he disrespect her, unnecessary nudity which,
Director knowns how to make money in that points which below...
Thats why 1.he used stardome of ranbeer kapoor
2.he used punjabi song and culture to attract punjab audience.3. He used rashmika for south indian audience
4.in middel he used marathi actor with popular marathi song to attract
Maharashtrian people.5.he used violence and nudity, alcohol, smoking to get popularity from gen Z
u can see this is trash for our society, in name of freedom of cinema making, director like him showing these film like kabir sing, animal.These films should be banned or play only on ott.",negative
10,Awesome Movie..Full on entertainment..Paisa Vasool,Idk why many people wrote utter nonsense about this movie may be they expect stuff like Kabhi Khushi kabhi gham. So i remind them it's KJO movie.This movie is not like other Bollywood's movie. This movie is 4 those people who understands what real content is all about. Actually This movie is not for POGO fans that's why they r so disappointed & crying like pussy (cat) here.After the wave of OTT content I feel Bollywood must have made movies like Animal more.I think Bollywood made a great come back with Animal & after so long I saw great excitement in audience to go & watch movie in a theatre otherwise from 3-4 years theatre were not full to their capacity so that's the power of Ranbir Kapoor's acting & great direction of a movie.,positive
7,A lot to like and a lot to be confused about,"Ok there's a lot to unpack here so let me go through each item.Acting:
If this rating was purely about acting it would be a 10/10 movie. Ranbir Kapoor produces one of the best performances I've seen in Hindi cinema in a long long time. He captures each emotion perfectly be it pain, anger, hope. Some solid performances by the supporting cast as well particularly from Anil Kapoor and Tripti Dimri.Plot:
This is where the movie falls down. There are way too many plot points without much cohesion between them. I think the first half of the movie laid some good groundwork which was not capitalised upon.Action:
Some really good action sequences (albeit unrealistic) and action choreography. This movie is very violent and gory so viewer discretion is advised if you are not a fan of blood and gore.Music:
Some very beautiful tunes that really add a lot to what is going on onscreen.Runtime:
A lot has been made of how long it is (3.5 hours!) but while watching it you don't really feel the length, the movie is very engaging and you won't be clock watching. The let down is that in all this time they couldn't come up with a cohesive storyline.Do I regret watching it? Absolutely not I think it was an engaging piece of art. Would I watch it again? Probably not now that the suspense is over (although maybe just for Ranbir's performance I might).",positive
10,Best movie India ever produced 👌 🙌 👏,What can I say I am so Impressed with this movie best action movie ever and please whoever posting negative comments about this movie is a sad person because people should be proud of ranbir kapoors acting and the producer who made such a masterpiece I can watch this movie again and again this was the best movie of all times. Loved it Indian people just love watching fake AI generated movies and doesn't like movies like Animal which is really sad. Everything looked so realistic it was brilliant 👏 I am really shocked to see why people are hating on this masterpiece it really baffled me. Wakeup people this is what u call an actual action movie.,positive
4,Character development?,"How did he learn to fight? He's singing while slaughtering a whole army by himself. I get the concept, but the lack of realism ruins the style the director wanted to create.Also, why does he love his dad so much? I don't buy the distant dad story. What's the real backstory, or is there even one?Why is his behavior always so awkward when he talks to people or approaches someone? Does he have anger issues? Maybe he has autism?So many questions about the main character. It's a good attempt, but there's a big lack of meaningful character development.Also, the movie is unnecessarily long. It could've been shorter and still conveyed the story well.",negative
10,ITS BLAST MOVIE,I watched animal and i was thinking till now that was the best best and most best movie i ever seen in my whole life .and i requests to director sandeep sir for this and hope you will came with animal 2 soon .we waiting love you sir and ranbir sir headsoff to you ❤... and the best action and acting kill the cinema 🎥 i was literally pured goosebumps in full time ⏲ in theater and really thanks to all of your team . I was never forget this movue and now at start with that time this was my best movie of all time ...loves to all actors and team for that blockbuster superhit giving ..love you ranbir sir ❤...,positive
6,Bollywood Quentin Tarantino Movie,"Ranvijay only wanted his father's time and attention. When he did not get it as a child, he grew into a rebellious young adult. After being exiled from the family, Ranvijay returns when an assassination attempt is made on his father. Taking the reins of the family, Ranvijay goes down a path to ensure his father is safe from harm, doing whatever is necessary to accomplish that goal.This film mixes a father-son drama and a Quentin Tarantino movie. This film has a lot to unpack. The film does an excellent job of juggling multiple themes, making it a remarkable story. The many twists and turns throughout the movie create a lot of plotholes and questions and make it long. The film has over-the-top violence and gore, but the action is realistic. The movie was criticized and controversial, but it is worth watching with an open mind.",negative
6,Ranbeer shines in a messy storyline.,"The best thing about the film is Ranbeer.Otherwise film has too many plot issues, unconvincing equations, character background not provided fully to convince the audience about what is happening and why is it happening. Film is stretched a lot in the middle.Now coming to some of the good things where people are unnecessarily bashing Wanga, he has actually shown women in strong light even with small roles, he has kept the 'hero' in greyish light with practical approach but he is actually not disrespectful to women as people are discussing. The shoe licking scene is being discussed totally out of context , it is not weird in story line.But overall, it seems like entire story was somehow stretched and structured just to show animal side of Ranbeer's character. Even the father-son equation was not fully convincing to me, may be it was complicated and some of the audience got it right, I would love to hear about it but I could not digest it. Actors who were discusses a lot are having relatively smaller roles - Bobby, Tripri, even Anil Kapoor.",negative
9,It's just INSANE,"It's mind-blowing.....it just love it. Ranbir Kapoor just nailed this character. He is in never seen avatar. The way he carried his character was mind-blowing. Everyone's screen presence is good. Bobby Deol's acting is next level, without saying a dailogue he just acted so well. His expressions, actions, everything thing is perfect. And acting without saying a single dialogue is tough but still he nailed by his expressions. It cut one star because of adult scenes why to unnecessary adult scenes ? The way there was Father-son plot it can be good family movie. Overall movie is good, it was a great experience.",positive
1,Complete BS!!!!! Dont watch it save your money,"This movie is complete BS no story too much things happening with no good reason. Please do not believe if someone says it is an outstanding movies because they are just influenced and not using their brain. Lets start with
Acting : Ranbir kapoor acting was brilliant but nothing new very much similar to what he has been doing, other were also great except Rashmika she needs some acting classes , her acting was so poor and her dialogue delivery in whole film is just meh she did very bad job.Story line: Boring story line only thing that makes it interesting is the violence. You will not feel any emotions means if they are sad you wont feel it . As an audience I find scenes very funny even when they were crying in scenes, as you will not be able to relate.For me when they cried or show any emotional scene it was like CRINGE.Save your time and Don't watch this film.Saying as an action lover this movie is the weirdest movie in negative way I have ever seen in my life.",negative
1,Worst movie of all time!,"Never seen such a worst and baseless film! The story is not up to the mark. Arjun reddy was far better movie. I wonder how they release it because they might have reviewed it after finishing it. I do not understand how people liked this kind of movie. It's not about the adult scenes but there is no story. Even after putting all unnecessary scenes with a long drag, the script is not convincing at all. This is an example of the movie that can never be recommended to any kind of age group as it just wastes your 3 plus hours of precious time. It was told that this film was focused on bond between father and son. But the director totally failed how to project such a beautiful bond in the form of a movie.",negative
1,Cringy garbage,"The movie hyped for all the wrong reasons, romanticized for wrong doings, someone need to check sanity of makers specially writer-director Sandeep Vanga.Movie where story is absent, movie full of illogical, excessive bloodbath & gore, absurd dialogues, world full of misogynist- chauvinist toxic masculine Alpha males,
woman are mere objects for sex, they don't have brains,Total cringe fest with excessive cringey dialogues, world where no law and order, police exists.Where psychopathic mad protagonist is being romanticized and glorified by public who
spent so much money to watch this garbage movie in theater, again proves the fact that nasty and filthy things still sold at a hight price in market. Worst movie I have watched in recent times.And worst part is, get ready for Animal Park.No thanks.",negative
10,Very Unique Movie,"Very Good Movie. Need to watch this movie as a movie and not as a moral thing.The Music and BGM is topclass
Ranbir Kapoor and Anil Kapoor's acting are standouts
Bobby Deol stole the show
Cool action scenes. The climax is epic
Don't miss the post credit scene.Also for those who think ranbir is abusive and hits girls, in movie Rashmika slaps Ranbir and at the and she gives him divorce for his affair.For me the best parts in movies were 1) Interval Action Scene 2)Bobby Deol's Entry 3) Ranbir Kapoor and Anil Kapoor scene at the climax (one of the best acting scenes) 4)Bobby VS Ranbir faceoff fight scene 5)This movie is very different. Give it a chance.",positive
7,Vanga'holic Masterpiece,"Had to saw a Bollywood movie after a long time & I'm not disappointed from this, This is the story of the emotional bond between father and son in which a son considers his father a superhero from childhood, his unconditional love for his father turns into obsession and the son becomes a criminal for the sake of his father's life. All the songs of the film are very touching. The first half is very good, but later on, the film dragged on so much that many scenes could have been omitted. Ranbir Kapoor has once again proved that acting is in his blood. There are many violent & obscene scenes, I advise you not to watch the movie with your family, but watch the movie for sure, it is very good, it will be fun !!🎬🎬🎬",positive
4,It Had No Business Being That Long and Violent,"Animal directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga is a mediocre mess. Now the technical aspects of this movie are really well done from the background score to the production design to the cinematography. The fight scenes are adrenaline boosters and despite being 3 1/2 hours long it is very engaging thanks to it's action.Aside from some good elements the movie largely falters in many aspects. The movie tries too hard to tell a story about the love between a father and a son however it all gets lost amidst the yelling, shooting, slashing and slicing. It feels like the story is trying to juggle too many plot points at once with a lot of it feeling underdeveloped. The pacing is atrocious. It goes from being a fast-paced story in the first act and then slows down so heavily during the second-act with some character interactions being too lengthy and could've been easily cut.Speaking of the characters, Ranbir Kapoor gives a phenomenal performance as Vijay however his character goes through abrupt shifts without much of a context. His father Balbir Singh, played fabulously by Anil Kapoor, is the only other character that gets some character development. Aside from the two Kapoors, all the other characters are boring and one-dimensional. Rashmika Mandanna gives a very weak performance as Gitanjali, whose only purpose is to get yelled yet by her husband without having much importance to the story. The villain or the villains aren't threatening enough and Tripti Dimri was boring but atleast she served somewhat of a purpose in the story.The emotional core of this movie is the relationship between Vijay and his father Balbir which only comes towards the end of the movie. The movie does a pretty good job at setting up their relationship in the beginning but then it all narrows down to constant yelling in which the real motive of the story is drowned out.Even though the action is pretty good it is overly violent with some scenes being extremely unsettling and distrubing to look at. Plus the protagonist is shown to be really misogynistic at some points.Overall Animal shines through it's technical achievements and some great performances from Ranbir Kapoor and Anil Kapoor, but falters heavily when it comes to telling a cohesive story. And if you're someone who cannot handle violence and gore, pls refrain from watching it.",negative
5,"A messy, cartoonish but entertaining affair","Animal is a heightened, over-the-top, cartoonish experience that celebrates the monstrosity of its titular character in spades. The movie is a mess, but an entertaining one nonetheless. It has pacing issues, it's all over the place and extremely choppy at times. Even at 3 hours and 22 minutes, you feel the father-son dynamic wasn't explored properly, as Anil Kapoor is completely sidelined. We all know this is a Ranbir Kapoor movie, but the way Anil Kapoor and Bobby Deol are treated as afterthoughts is frustrating. Also, the movie has tonal issues aplenty; some of the writing, especially the dialogues, is painfully bad and it has absolutely no moral center. However, Ranbir's stupendous performance as this monster, the action sequences, and the film's overall story keep you captivated enough to make it just about a decent time at the cinema. The ending, which is a cliffhanger of sorts, does bring in some more excitement even though it doesn't make an iota of sense.Overall, Animal is not a good movie - in fact, its quite an ugly film and quite a mess, but sometimes, messes are also entertaining to watch.",negative
1,Misogyny for attention makes box office success.,"I am convinced that sandeep reddy vanga makes bad, misogynistic movies just to create controversy and ride that hype which he created from negative publicity. He is using that dhinchak pooja theory ""people will want to watch how bad my content is"" which is why theatres are full not because the movie is good but just because it is controversial.Acting : Good
Cinematography and sound : Good
Storyline : Average
Music : Good at times but sometimes didn't suit the background.It could have been a good movie if it was not misogynistic and sexist. If you want to portray a troubled character don't add bgs to every stupid thing he does.",negative
9,"Mass Entertainment, BGM and Acting",The movie stands up to its name Animal and directors guidance to not watch it with family. It shows the extent to which a son goes for his dad's attention and how the upbringing has an effect on the personality. The BGM alone is enough for a person to book a seat at the theatre where it's true value can be experienced and yes they speak openly about sex and may get intimate a little over the top but it can again be attributed to the personality of the lead. Overall a must watch movie in theatre but preferably with friends rather than family and definitely not kids. Try getting a ticket at a theatre with good sound system.,positive
10,Fantastic thrilling pucch,"Oh my gawd amazing movie, Vanga ready has arrived in style, action and fire. The movie does not leave you for a moment, the trailer was amazing and hence had to watch first day here in Canada. Unseen action, unseen vision , unseen emotions personally for this movie and I do watch movies a lot. Ranbirrrrrrrr praaaa stellar performance I am going to watch this movie so many times that I am ready to get a rash :). Rashmikaaa has put her soul. Anil Kapoor is a class act . Nobody can touch his performance emotion were intense. But Ranbir is clearly in the elements free fearlesss powerfullll fits right on the name Animal.And for the puccch in the title go watch the movie.",positive
5,Disappointing,"Expected way more, failed to deliver. Vangaa has a problem that he thinks whatever he feels is right, but its not. He has dragged the plot way to too much, and its a pain to tolerate the second half. Ranbir Kapoor is an outstanding actor, he has acted so good, but alas the plot has betrayed him! Lots of loopholes, and doesn't make any sense. So many murders and not a single police? How come? Ranbir did so much for his father and then the father died off Leukomia? You kidding me? Why Ranbir feels so much love for his dad? Okay, he loves his father, whats the motivation of the cousins who took part in the bloodbath?",negative
10,Blockbuster Hit of Ranbir,"Ranbir from a chocolate boy to Action and angry man this transformation is just a wow.. I have seen new Ranbir Kapoor in this movie. He has done a great job seriously.You will see the bobby Deol Charm here, his entry is nothing less than a more wild. His role is not that much as i expected, but the end was really unexpected.Anil kapoor is always the best when its come to show a powerful person.I think instead of using Rashmika original voice they should opt for dubbing, Rashmika expression was damn good but we have to concentrate alot to understand her dialogue as she wasn't feeling comfortable with Hindi language, which we can easily make out that.Overall Ranbir Kapoor took the movie like Rocket.He is true Rocket Singh.Must watch only in theatres to take the feel of it.",positive
1,Worst Gross Movie of Bollywood,"This movie is a piece of s***. Stupid movie. Not a family movie . They are trying to copy Hollywood but it doesnt suit our indian culture. WORST MOVIE EVER. Movie.senseless story line , senseless dialogues specially Ranbir's.The movie like this spoiling our Indian culture.Very disappointing.Copied scenes from Fifty shades of grey. According to me fifty shades was much better than this movie.Please dont go with family to watch this movie.

10,JUST THE BEST STORYLINE AMAZING PERFORMACE BY RANBIR,"This movie just changed my pov for bollywood and ranbir kapoor great work team. Ranbir Kapoor, the scion of Bollywood's illustrious Kapoor family, continues to enthrall audiences with his mesmerizing performances, proving time and again that he is a true cinematic virtuoso. In an industry abundant with talent, Kapoor stands out not only for his lineage but for the sheer brilliance he brings to each role he undertakes.What sets Ranbir Kapoor apart is his chameleon-like ability to seamlessly embody a diverse range of characters. From the lovable and carefree Sid in ""Wake Up Sid"" to the emotionally charged Jordan in ""Rockstar,"" Kapoor's versatility is a testament to his acting prowess. He doesn't merely play roles; he inhabits them, bringing an authenticity and depth that elevates every film he graces.One of Kapoor's defining traits is his fearlessness in choosing unconventional roles. Whether it's the endearing Barfi with his expressive silence or the complex and tormented Sanjay Dutt in ""Sanju,"" Kapoor fearlessly dives into the intricacies of each character, delivering performances that are both nuanced and captivating truly loved his movie animal just a fan now.",positive
9,Animal as the name itself reflects the cinema is wild animal,First of all the beginning of the movie itself is beasty it will keep you interested to explore what the movie has to offer and to make things more easier for South Indians the charm of Rashmika who is now crushmika of India. Ranbir Kapoor new outlook and experimental way of acting can be seen without a doubt but what is more intriguing is school days enrage which has shown in the plot and feel somewhere the movie lags and then suddenly the father and son duo emotional journey keeps you till the end of the movie so movie buffs this is the movie for you to sit and watch for straight 3 hours and it worth it.!!!,positive
5,A movie that glorifies violence with one-liners and slo-mo.,"So... This was a drama... An action... A romance... Even seemed like black comedy in some ways due to the adult jokes. So, let's say an amalgamation of a few genres.Let's get on with what works:
Of course, the thing that sparks the movie is the acting of the Male lead. So many timelines and scenarios for a character... So, yeah, it is indeed as good as people are saying.What didn't work (at least for me):
After some long scenes of dramatic family fights (and unwanted violence and questionable actions) at the start, we finally get to, let's say, the juicy part of the story, and the movie picks up for an hour. But, then we get an intermission...Now, The second half? Well, that's where I was rolling my eyes here and there because I was finally getting why people were kinda scared for the 3 and a half hour movie. Because the scenes in the second half screamed to be edited out!Have to be honest, this would've gotten four stars if the ending didn't end that way. It managed to surprise me. So, that's a pro if anything...

The fact that the whole movie would've been nothing if the Male Lead sought therapy as a child is something I keep going back it...",negative

6,Not that great but worth a watch,"This is mainly a drama. How the father-son bond goes. I didn't quite get what they wanted to show in that. He fights with him a lot, didn't like how his father treated him in childhood but somehow loves him a lot.The comedy never clicked but that wasn't really part of the film.This does promote the so called 'alpha male' unevidential crap. Anyone watching please notice these things and don't implement in your lives. Treat woman with respect.The action isn't as much as I expected. I would have liked more but whatever the amount was good.Some drama scenes are also done pretty nicely. The BGM really works.Maybe it was the length but I was just waiting for the action scenes to come.All in all, I would have loved this movie if It was around 2hr30min long than 3hr 15min.",negative
10,Good,"This is surely one of the best movies that bollywood has produced in the last 10 years in terms of entertainment. All things from storyline to music and from action scenes to quality of acting are brilliantly planned and executed. Even though the running time of the movie is almost 3.5 hours you actually don't feel its length.RK has really nailed it this time. This performance can be surely counted as one of his very best in terms of quality of acting. As much as I want to say the same thing for Rashmika, the element of common sense is simply not allowing me. Firstly, the quality of acting displayed by her is disappointing compared to her previous performances. And further I am still not able to understand why someone like her accepted the movie after reading the script.(may be due to RK). The character she plays feels like a clown in the movie.",positive
10,Spectacular!!!,"""Animal"" is unlike anything that came out of Bollywood. Raw, unapologetic, intense.Animal shines in every department, be it direction, screenplay, background score, action choreography, acting.Story is basic bt one of the finest screenplay i've seen from a bollywood movie. People who are complaining about the misogyny part, they actually didnt understand the movie at all. Its a journey of an edgy character who throughout the movie became an animal. Writer, who is also Director Vanga, smartly knitted the plot for mature people who can understand the hidden gems.3 hour 21 min is long bt the extra runtime was helpful for immersive experience. Editing was sharp. I dint even touch my phone in theatre which explain how good the movie.Every cast member was perfect for their roles. Ranbir Kapor outdone himeself, No word can justify his portrayal as Ranvijay .. Anil kapor, Bobby Deol, Rashmika Mandana and rest of the cast gives solid performance.",positive
2,India's experimental failure,"The 2 stars are only there for two reasons, 1) the automobile machine gun was a brilliant idea and such a concept i havent even viewed in Hollywood movies, 2) Animal was going for a niche approach and be experimental but failed.Firstly, the narrative is not very strong, unnecessary details and story aspects are focused on that you loose the main point of the plot. The dialogues are literally like, ""take this English dialogue and translate into hindi, which evidently doesnt work, the so called ""badass"" people in india surely dont speak like that. Overall there is no grip in the story and you can feel the timerun making you hungry and thinking about the meal ahead... This is the biggest wasted potential i have seen, but with saying that, i do agree that if done right, this movie would have been revolutionary.",negative
10,BEST MOVIE IVE SEEN IN A WHILE,Ranbir kapoor did an amazing work. His acting made the character likeable and gave it the edge it needed. He has always proved himself as an excellent actor. The movie had a great storyline and every character played its part perfectly. 100% recommend everyone to watch it. The movie displayed a very toxic relationship between a father and son which not everyone is capable of depicting . All the acttors did a wonderful job . Ranbir Kapoor did exceptionally well and needs to be applauded . It's a long movie but the story is definitely worth it . Bollywood hasn't made a movie like this in a while.,positive
10,Ride gets you adrenaline rush,"Acting is clas apart , engrossing to the level one won't be able to point out flaws in plot
Deliver more than promised on all fronts.It's difficult to get the audience glued for 03:30 hrs without cheers or booing.The pace is exhiliarting Ranbir Anil Bobby and Rashmika create magic and do justice to their character.Am sure Vanga had loads to tell and whatever he did was more than what one can get had it not been slick editing and story telling
Effort shows from scene one to last.Scenes between fathe son, husband wife are so natural it's like everyday conversation for the societal context.Ranbir refreshes in each frame Bobby instills fear.",positive
10,No.1 Bollywood Action Movie,"No doubt Animal is the no.1 actiona film of bollywood. Pure action, no south indian movie type action although almost equal to hollywood action flick. Salute to the most versatile actor of bollywood. Even though the movie duration is long but that doesn't reduce any interest in movie. Just like shahid made kabir singh ranbir made animal. Eagerly waiting for animal park. Longest action sequence in bollywood. Jawaan, Pathaan, War, Tiger 1,2,3, Krrish are nowhere near this movie. Ranbir do the perfect justice with the role. Father son relationship shown in this movie was too much emotional. Hatts off to ranbir kapoor and team.",positive
10,Must Read,"Long Time Long Time.... I repeat Long time...
One of the best action Movie with proper emotions' BGM the class the attitude nd also the Acting performance of each nd every charactor including Ranbir nd Bobby OMG man OMG.

A big Big Clap just plz bring the 2nd chapter ASAP nd no doubt i just wana say without any doubt just Go nd watch :)",positive
8,"Next step in Indian cinema, don't listen to the haters !","The haters of this movie are very emotional and irrational. They have no logic about it. They just hate it because it they are offended at it. But it's just a movie and a good one. It's fictional. It's not real, it's all made up. The haters won't understand this.Sandeep Reddy Vanga directed this brilliantly. The editing was so good. The song choices were superb and they will get stuck in your head for sure. And the BGM feels so premium, so unique that it elevates each and every scene to another level.Ranbir Kapoor acted his heart out in this and it shows. Rashmika also did good and so did Anil. Bobby Deol stood out amongst them all easily. However I do feel the action scenes could be a lot better than this.The story is very detailed and it takes you on a journey of a man's descent. It feels fresh because we finally see unapologetic masculinity in a movie after a long time in Bollywood. Kudos to the Animal team and I'm very excited about the sequel.If you are an adult and want to watch a mature movie, this is it for you. If you see a movie as art, this is for you. If you want to see just morally good things on screen, this is not for you.",positive
10,Great movie after a long time,"Great Movie.... Sandeep Reddy Vanga gave us all what he had said. Violence, Romantic,go*e scenes.....all of them were too good. Ranbir Kapoor's performance was just top notch. Songs ,which u must have heard by now , they were lovely. This was just another dimension of Rk's acting which was hidden and Sandeep Vanga has brought that out with so much perfection. Yes, don't miss the post credit scene which was just cherry on the cake. Some people (poetry lovers kind of) may find some scenes disturbing but u know this movie has been made to deliver it and it has done with utmost perfection. Rashmika's acting was also good , she might not be the protagonist but you can see her contributing to most of the scenes.",positive
7,This movie will surely change the history of INDIAN CINEMA,"One of the best Indian movie of 2023 and also of all time, infact for me, this is the best Indian movie I've ever seen.A film that contains absolutely masterclass screenplay, cinematography, editing, VFX, dialogues with world class action scenes (though in some scenes, the action sequences are little bit over the top and some part in the second half is little bit slow but that doesn't make any difference in it's superiority) and loads of emotions.Love this film, surely a worth to watch movie.Note:
Movie has many violent and gory scenes with nudity (not fully shown) and many controversial things are shown. People who get easily triggered in sensitive things are needed to think twice before watching it..",positive
8,Decent Movie,"""Animal"" is a good movie with a captivating storyline and impressive performances. However, it's not entirely family-friendly due to some scenes unsuitable for children and parents. The lengthy 3-hour 21-minute runtime could have benefited from trimming.Ranbir Kapoor delivers a standout performance, while Rashmika Mandanna's acting falls slightly short. The action scenes, especially the interval gun firing and Arjan Valleyne song, are exceptionally well-executed.The songs are average overall, but Arjan Valleyne stands out. Tripti's portrayal of Zoya adds depth to the movie, although some scenes between characters could have been trimmed. Emotions play a significant role, comprising almost three hours of the film.While ""Animal"" is a decent watch for friends or solo viewers, its A certification (18+) makes it unsuitable for family and children. Despite these considerations, the movie earns a commendable 8/10 rating.",positive

8,FAR BETTER THAN THE MISOGYNY AND CHAUVINISM DEBATE,"From Writer Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga famous for the fame of Arjun Reddy and Kabir Singh comes an absolute blast of a movie which is enticing entertaining and emotional at core which will definitely make you feel thing about the movie long after the credits will roll.Well it's not all praise and roses for the movie it certainly has its flaws but mainly in the screenplay which comes to almost a screeching halt in the second half after an exhilarating first half which will keep you on the edge of your seats. The credit for which goes to the spectacular BGM which just elevates all the important scenes in the film and the non linear style of filmmaking which is unique in it's own way.I have heard many complaints as how they have glorified the Alpha male and machovism and belittled the opposite gender and I too found some scenes unnecessary provoking to some extent but nothing came in way of my loving of the film which is just so profound and impactful. Most of the criticism is coming from those who haven't even seen the film (May be in the reels or insta) and yet giving their baseless criticism without knowing the context in which they have seen it. I fail to see how misogyny and chauvinism have become the highlight of this film which depicts the Man in Charge (Ranbir Kapoor)as an aplha Male and this is the lie he lives in the entire film which only results in something that would be a spoiler at this point of time and it's not like they have given the name of the film Animal just for you to sympathise with the character but the reverse of it. I don't know why nobody is talking about the spectacular BGM and Soundtracks which is the best I have heard this whole year, why nobody is talking about the performances of the leads which could be their career best. Well to answer that we all chose to see negative over positive, it's in our nature and this is also the message of the movie. Had it been a disaster at box office nobody would have uttered a single word let alone criticise it.What I really adored about this movie were the lead performances of the Father and the son played exceptionally well by Anil Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor respectively. Performance wise If I were to judge both the actors this was the Magnum opus for me.Now coming to it's flaws what became it's strong point in the first half becomes a con for me, it's the screenplay which takes a completely different approach, a more linear approach if you will. It's not bad thing in my opinion telling your story linearly but after watching the first half so fast paced or it's looks like due to it's non linear approach the second half really was Downer for me but not emotionally I might add. 15-20 minutes could have been easily trimmed which would have only made it more sharp and impactful. Bobby Deol also is so underutilised in the film which is also kind of a bummer for everyone as by the looks of the trailers everyone was expecting him to have major screentime Alas it's not the case here.Now let's wrap up the review by saying that this movie really touched me in ways I can't begin to explain although it's entirely a subjective opinion of mine and I don't expect anyone to go through the same feeling I had whilst watching it.VERDICT: 4/5PS: STAY AWAY FROM CRITICS AND LIBERALS.",positive
1,Non Sense - Logic less,"I have watched this movie yesterday, since then I am completely disturbed, what a senseless movie, it's ok show elevations and heroism at peaklevel like KGF but this movie is completely logicless, mindless and should be completely avoided , Mr. Sandeep Reddy Vanga may belive in psycho path movies but as a writer i believe that he should change the stroies , now come to the story it kind of simple revenge drama where some one tried to kill heroes father and herecomes our hero to protect his father , an over agressive, mindless , brutal ,Akha animal played by Mr rambir Kapoor , how he takes the revange is the story, but now comes the issue hero's character behaves like complete psycho and behaves as per the directors will , unnecessary bold scenes, logic less fight scenes, clarity less strory telling makes this movie a headache, though it may earn 1000 crores (due to controversies) this movie you should never in life watch with family and completely avoid your kids to watch.",negative
1,"Violence, killings and justifying it for love","It's such a useless movie with a very negative message, I wonder how it got sensor board approval. Killing 300 plus people openly without any consequences , not even 1 scene talks about law and order and justice, in facts violence and killings are justified for love. It is a Shame that people are not only creating movies like this but they are even becoming box office success.Almost all the lead male characters were treating women like garbage and again they were doing it for love. Such negative impact on youth this movie should be banned.None of the actors have many dialogues except ranvir Kapoor.",negative
1,Worst Movie Ever,"DADDY COMPLEX !!! Made absolutely zero sense. Just slashing and nothing else. Blood and illogic drama all over. Absolutely nonsense movie, never would watch it again or recommend anyone to do so. It would have been much better to give my money to a poor person instead of wasting it on this movie's ticket. People who seriously need some mental evaluation will enjoy a movie like this. No story, no logic, no laws, no acting, just not worth a dime. Disgusting movie. Folks, do not fall for this movie, it's just Ranbir acting as a mentally deranged person in the whole movie. Just absolutely hate this movie.",negative
6,Watch if you love violence and bold scenes,"Rest all the actors played good role and defined their characters specifically Anil Kapoor and all Punjabi cousins loved them and the war cry. First half machine gun bike scene top... above alll....That's it a good movie and must watch if you like hard music and aggression and hardcore action.Action scenes are highlight of the movie and enotional scenes are equally well crafted, especially the last Ranbir-Anil scene, which really makes the audience cry.In this action-packed film, Bobby Deol impressively demonstrates his emotive prowess, relying on expressions rather than words to leave audiences astonished.",negative
7,Slowed and violet movie,"It was excited movie with action but little bit slow version of the movie on second half
The movie glorifies violence, physical
That the Ranbir is on the hunt for Bobby Deol, and the movie is building towards an intense climax. Interesting revelations about a shocking incident in Ranbir's family unfold, and Ranbir nails the scene. Now, it's time for the axe fight with the masked men. Things are getting intense, and the audience is pumped up as the popular track Arjan Vailly adds more excitement to the action The movie takes a serious turn as Ranbir unites his cousins for revenge. A big twist in the tale.",positive
10,Very good movie,"It's a very good movie.A film that's neither entertaining nor has anything to say. The cinematic equivalent of a teenager having a hormonal temper tantrum. Ranbir Kapoor is Ranvijay, who, as you probably surmised from the trailer has everything money can buy, except his father's love and attention.My head is an animal...,"" goes a line in a famous song from the Icelandic band Of Monsters and Men. Sandeep Reddy Vanga's protagonists - thick-headed creatures of privilege and entitlement - are all badly-behaved men who could easily pass for monsters. After Arjun Reddy (2017) and Kabir Singh (2019), two films about a chain-smoking doctor with anger issues, the director returns with Animal, his second Hindi feature, about a chain-smoking engineer with deep-seated daddy issues. Yet no matter how bleak and paleolithic his view of human.",positive
10,progressively intense character on a relentless quest.,"""Animal"" is a riveting exploration of a progressively intense character on a relentless quest. The film intricately delves into the intricate layers of the protagonist's personality, offering a compelling narrative that keeps audiences captivated.

The movie's unique storytelling approach and unwavering pace contribute to an unforgettable cinematic experience. Additionally, the glimpse into the father-son relationship adds a poignant layer, providing depth to the protagonist's motivations and actions.",positive
7,"Not enough action, lost potential","So, this movie is much discussed & much debated about. Honestly the script is not that bad & some scenes definitely make you question the logic of this movie. But it is still a good movie. My only problem with it is that there is not enough action.They should've limited the drama a little bit & focused more on the action part of the movie. Afterall, that is its selling part, not much of the drama. The drama is not bad but it could've definitely been reduced & more action scenes could've been included.This movie definitely has the potential. Maybe they ahould make sequel more action packed.",positive
7,Animal: A Rollercoaster of Intensity and Gore,"In this adrenaline-fueled action-packed thriller, viewers are catapulted into a world of vengeance and retribution as the son of a powerful industrialist returns home to protect his father from imminent threats.The film delivers an explosive blend of heart-stopping action, visceral violence, and relentless revenge. From pulse-pounding chase sequences to bone-crunching fight scenes, this movie keeps audiences on the edge of their seats from start to finish.With a stellar cast delivering electrifying performances, each actor embodies their role with intensity and conviction. Their portrayal of characters driven by revenge adds layers of depth to the narrative, drawing viewers deeper into the web of intrigue and betrayal.As the story unfolds, themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the thirst for justice collide in a whirlwind of high-octane excitement. The film's unapologetic approach to violence serves as a visceral reminder of the stakes at hand, driving home the brutal realities of the characters' quest for retribution.While some may shy away from the film's graphic depiction of violence, it serves as a powerful catalyst for the narrative's relentless momentum. Every punch thrown and bullet fired propels the story forward, leading to a climactic showdown that leaves no stone unturned.In the realm of action cinema, this movie stands as a testament to the genre's enduring appeal. It is a pulse-pounding thrill ride that satisfies the adrenaline junkie in all of us, offering a visceral experience that lingers long after the credits roll.",positive
10,Best 3 Hours Spent (no regrets) King Ranbir Kapoor,"The movie had been terrific, like each and everything. Ranbir has just set some high bars after this movie. Story line had been amazing, the son and father thing is a sensational story and I could relate too. Next level goosebumps, what a movie !!! In my opinion, he had been a big actor then his dad in the movie and as well in the life too. The whole plot and the twists have amazingly shown. The action and cinematics were top of the line ! 3 hours plus spent on this movie. Not a single minute is wasted and regretted for. Every scene of the movie worths the watch. Gonna rewatch this again 3hrs straight!!!",positive
8,"In the world of sheep, only the wolf will get it!","We live in a peaceful progressive world today. But dont mistake it for being a status quo. We never know when the collapse of society will begin again. Its hilarious how people belittle toxic masculinity and act as if it will disappear. Its just a trait among the Alpha Male genes. The strongest genes in a family. Alphas are not taught, they are born that way. In the time of chaos they are the ones who will protect humanity! Its understandable that their methods will not be liked by the masses. There is no good or bad, there is only strong and weak! This movie is a glimpse of a male fantasy. Its quite an interesting and artistic depiction. The Alpha trying to protect his family from outside threats. Undeterring love for the father! Even the moments in the movie that dont make sense were deliberately created that way. The movie is faithful to the source material thus not appealing to everyone. Remember, Girly tough aint enough!",positive
7,Movie was good but lengthy.,"Great to see such a huge RK. He just killed it with his acting. I am big fan of Bobby so not a single bad word for him although his character was very tiny in whole film and tried to justice with his acting.Rashmika, tried her level best and did justice to her character too.Anil sir is really fit and as usual no comments on your acting as he kill with his josh and energy.Coming back to direction, it was really good. As a critic, this film was a bit lengthy.Overall, I would recommend people to watch this movie once.Director Sahab tusi chha gaye yaar. This sort of work should be use cases for others in Hindi Cinema.",positive
7,"The movie is titled 'Animal', not 'Human'","It is wrong to say this movie had divided opinion, with an overwhelming amount of reviews rating 1/10 and a smaller but sizeable group rating this 6, 7 or 8 tells you which group is objective and which one is driven by pure hate.Anyway, regarding the movie, It is portrayal of a twisted protagonist, who clearly has a lot of psychological issues stemmed of course from his upbringing. Having childhood issues is of course not unheard of, but having that along with a lot of money & backed by political power will only lead to an individual which is aptly described by the title of the movie, an 'Animal'. This animal is deprived of validation from his father and wants to compensate that by any means which makes him feel more masculine, many of these means are of course socially unacceptable (hence the hate in reviews). But here is the missing point in hate, this is a guy you don't want to root for. Even the director doesn't want you to root for the protagonist, that's why he titled this movie as animal. He knew what he was doing, that's why the reckless nature of Ranbir's character gets punished multiple times in the movie. Even the closing of movie leaves the character in agony. He recklessly achieved the goal and short term satisfaction but comes at a cost. Vanga doesn't hail the character, just portrays it on screen (& beautifully I might add). The narration is good, it goes back and forth in time to keep the audience hooked and action sequences add to the entertainment you seek from a piece for which you pay big bucks to watch it on screen.So cinematography is clearly good, background music is fantastic as well, acting has been superb by Ranbir & Anil K who carried the movie but also by other actors. Rashmika did really well in her portrayal of spouse of an animal who cared genuinely but always knew this manic character will eventually spell doom for them. Vanga gets her character to convey important aspects of protagonist in the movie (fighting ghosts in head, the obsession with father being a disease etc.) & she frequently exposes the shallow nature of her husband. Bobby D said a thousand words with his facial expressions only but also notable was Saurabh Sachdeva (Abid) whose acting was really genuine.What could have made the movie better of course was depth in story & build of characters. Few things are rushed (even for a 3hr+ movie) like Dimri's character's entanglement with protagonist, Jija's arc & Bobby's story too (but I hope that gets covered in part 2).It is an entertaining piece to go in theatre (Zoo?) and see what animal behaviour looks like. This is not for inspiration or learnings and certainly not for snowflakes who cannot respect different perspectives & get offended by anything politically incorrect. Vanga tests the limits of contemporary societal norms on so many occasions that people who mind any violation will just feel tortured throughout the movie.It's not perfect, it's not politically correct, it's not for inspiration, and it's definitely not 'human'. It is enjoyable, it is entertaining, it is brute, intense and hardcore, like an ANIMAL.Peace :)",positive
1,I can't rate it a negative so it's a 1,"No explanation needed. But if you really need one then go watch the movie and watch the movie with your partner and just see what they say. No sane person in this entire planet would want to watch this movie again. Insane people: director, producer, the actors for thinking this would AMAZING, people who love this movie and people who rated this a 10/10. If you disagree with me go argue with a wall. So many moments made me scream at the director for thinking he's such a genius. Please make all these people get checked out by a psychiatrist. 🙏🙏🙏 After all of this the only thing I really want to know is what Alia Bhatt's real review of this film is, not the one she says to the press or her stupid husband who accepted this film.",negative
7,A new experiment in Bollywood,"""Animal"" boasts a star-studded cast, but it's Ranbir Kapoor who steals the show with his stellar performance. Despite playing a slightly odd character, he delivers a convincing portrayal that keeps you hooked. The background music adds depth to the scenes, enhancing the overall viewing experience.While I may not agree with director Sandeep Reddy Vanga's opinions, I approached ""Animal"" purely as a movie. It's undeniably a bold venture, breaking new ground in Bollywood with its unconventional storyline.However, Rashmika Mandanna's dialogue delivery is poor. It's disappointing that talented actress like Tripti Dimri wasn't given ample scope to showcase her acting prowess. Bobby Deol was surprisingly good.Overall, ""Animal"" is a mixed bag.",positive
10,Another Baahubali !! Great delivery,"""I would like to commend Sandeep Reddy Vanga for delivering another impactful film following Kabir Singh and Arjun Reddy. In Animal, the movie combines intense action reminiscent of South Indian films with a beautiful chemistry involving family, friends, and loved ones.The protagonist, Balbir Singh, hails from a middle-class or farming background in Punjab. Despite being a wealthy individual, he maintains a humble heart, a result of establishing an empire through hard work and perseverance.The film features bold scenes and dialogues used judiciously, although some may have been restricted by the censor board. The director has intelligently cast characters who bring his vision to life.While there are unanswered aspects in the movie, the announcement of Animal Part 2 suggests that these gaps will be addressed. The initial part focuses on family drama and emotional elements, reminiscent of another successful film, Baahubali, by SS Rajamouli. Baahubali Part 1 also had a lengthy runtime and family drama, but the anticipation built in Part 2 drew massive public interest.In conclusion, I urge you to be patient and await the sequel, as there are likely to be revelations about Balbir Singh's brother, their sons, and the untold history of Swastik Steel's early days. There's more to this story, and Part 2 promises to unveil the mysteries.",positive
1,A movie for sadists,"Animal movie can very well be summarized in 4 words - Emotionless, brainless, ruthless, cold. Only a sadist would love this kind of movie. A couple of good soundtracks & few good scenes cannot make this movie good. Overall a soulless movie which is badly fragmented & tastes very bad. I won't recommend it to anyone.Animal movie can very well be summarized in 4 words - Emotionless, brainless, ruthless, cold. Only a sadist would love this kind of movie.

9,A Mixed Bag of Action and Emotions.,"Animal boasts an undeniably captivating first half, fueled by the solid performances of Ranbir Kapoor, Anil Kapoor, and Bobby Deol. Bobby in particular, deserves a longer role as he shines brightly in his limited screen time. While Rashmika Mandanna delivers an average performance, Charu Shankar steals the show with her powerful portrayal despite a smaller role.Ranbir Kapoor's transformation and intense acting evoke comparisons to his Sanju portrayal, drawing further attention to the film's central theme: a complex father-son relationship. The inclusion of Marathi actor Upendra Limaye and the use of a Marathi song during an action scene add a unique cultural touch that elevates the experience.Kapoor's acting, particularly in the action sequences, reminiscent of Hollywood legends Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, especially in ""The Godfather."" While the film's music could have been stronger, the haunting ""Arjan Vailly"" leaves a lasting impression.The film's climax cleverly leaves the door open for a sequel, hinting at further exploration of this captivating story.Overall, Animal is a flawed but entertaining film with a powerhouse performance by Ranbir Kapoor. While some aspects like the music and character development could be improved, the strong central performances and engaging storyline make it a worthwhile watch.",positive
5,Pseudo intellectual,"One hit wonder Sandeep Reddy tries to stretch the same formula too far with Animal. He tries to infuse too many anti social item bits into his threadbare thin plot to the movie's detriment. If only he was not spoiled with the huge success his one hit wonder movie Arjun Reddy received, he probably would have been sane enough to see that all those supposed to be shocker item bits were actually spoiling his movie which probably could have been a good enough movie especially so since Ranbir gives a lifetime performance. One US online reviewer aptly jokes (it's true) that it isn't children friendly, in fact it isn't even human friendly and it is probably just animal friendly.",negative
7,All Father & Sons should watch this movie together,"Larger than life but overall a entertainer, realistically brutal, and gripping movie.Love chemistry is awesome between Ranbin and Rasmika. Rasmika just killed it. She is my new favourite now.Ranbir's attitude in playing the character was awesome. Very nicely executed. One of his best performances i think.Father and son chemistry is a typical indian father-son chemistry, but climax could have been better picturized considering all the powerful performers at the disposal, which could have taken the impact to a totally different level.Bobby deol could have had more scenes but yet he was fab.Apart from above totally enjoyed the movie.",positive
7,Conflicting Reviews but it's not bad,"Since the reviews were so conflicting and to an extent extreme of nature, I was not sure what to expect. My expectations were very low.It turned out not to be a bad watch, the movie managed to put all elements of action, emotions, life, relationships, and love. With a unique focus on the complicated relationship between a father and son. To top it, the direction and a giving was too notch. Bobby Deol seemed wasted but his limited role has taken him to fame, happy for him.It was nice to witness:",positive
3,Don't watch .. please !!!,"Watching a movie shouldn't evoke such anger. Public figures, especially actors in a country influenced by films, should uphold social responsibilities. ""Animal"" lacks a meaningful story, mistreats people (particularly women), and excessively validates misogyny, elitism, and narcissism. The industry should aim for improved storytelling, nuanced character portrayals, and steer clear of glorifying problematic characters solely for entertainment purposes. It wasnt a movie at all . The director doesn't have a story to tell. He is just responding to critics allegation and showing a knee jerk sort of reaction. Useless violent scenes unjustified for the characters potrayed. No efforts in building the characters. And a wasted ranbir kapoors acting prowess. The movie had potential to be a cult classic had it just stuck to a villian vs villian narrative in a gang war setting. However this senseless concoction is bitter even when watching with zero expectations. DON'T WATCH !!!1*/5*",negative
1,Is there any relevance in this movie?,"Objectifying women in the name of AlPHA male , is not ok .Violence from protagonist of this movie is really not commendable. The people who are thinking ""HERO"" as his role model, then what will he learn from him. I was expecting the protagonist to accept his mistake in the end to provide atleast some relevance to this movie but no there was nothing like that. The Hero was being ignored from his father and what he did to his children, Nothing, he also did the same thing. A woman is tolerating n saying to kill another woman for her husband's mistake rather than punishing him is not acceptable.",negative
8,Worth a Watch !! It's upto you how do you take it. No fault.,"Ranbir Kapoor as Ranvijay ""Vijay"" Singh and Aziz Haque were simply exceptional. There are many characters in the film, and all are delivered performance in the range between decent to good. However, apart from Ranbir, one more key character which gave me some sort of fresh and amazing feeling is Saurabh Sachdeva's character as Abid Haque, his style of performance was outstanding. I believe he will get more opportunities in big films down the line. There are many things to talk about from the film, importantly, I believe director Sandeep wanted to attract a large audience, for that he smartly included few scenes, background music, and dialogues which otherwise are not required. The story revolves around how much protagonist Vijay loves his father, not only his father but how much he loves his sisters/family too. Romance is fine. When it comes to the action/killing sequences, especially couple of scenes sounded like the director has been inspired from the movies such as ""Kaithi"" and ""Vikram"". The first half went well. Post interval movie goes with few dull moments and gives a feel of dragging a bit, however director covered that with interesting ending. All in all, it's a big movie and worth watching.",positive
10,One of the best movie Bollywood has ever made!!!,"I saw this movie's trailer almost 20 times because it gave a very different vibe which I usually don't get by watching any trailer. And I knew it from that day that this movie is something different and I was super excited about this movie and yesss, when i watched this movie, my godddd!!!!!, what a movie.Every single minute was filled with excitement of what's coming next, even after being so long it made me fill like ""I want more!!"".And I know people have a very different opinion on this movie and a lot of controversies going around that, and even in my family my sisters, my cousins,y uncle, they didn't like the movie but that's alright cause everybody have a different opinion but I will just say that this movie completed me like I'm not even exaggerating, after watching this movie this movie i feeled like I was missing on something or just somthing was incompleted which got completed, like this is so new so different and so my type, and if have this kind of taste in movie you are gonna lovvveeee thisss movie, like everything is so perfect, Ranbir Kapoor's acting my goddd, he is the best, then the OG Anil kapoor sir and Bobby deol killed it, everyone was so perfect.

6,Movie story had great potential but...,"There were high hopes from this movie, especially it's story but the director and the writers didn't explore it's true potential at all.Till the interval block, audience remains hooked but post it, the movie starts becoming Messier.The story and screenplay could have elevated the movie post interval.Characters of Bobby Deol, Anil Kapoor and Suresh Oberoi weren't given enough screen time and character arch to be honest.Anil Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor shine in their roles, the latter one definitely keeps the audience interested in the movie.God knows why they selected Rashmika Mandana.Bobby Deol has been wasted totally, a lot was expected out of his character after the trailer.The Sikh cousins of Ranbir Kapoor have played their parts quite well.Tripti Dimri just adds to the oomph and skin show in the movie.The director tried to make Neo Noir action drama but failed at various junctures.The background music, songs and the well choreographed action are the backbone of this movie.Watch it only on OTT otherwise you will get bored in theatre while sitting for almost 3 hrs and 30 minutes.If such movies start be becoming blockbusters then God save the content based movies.",negative
3,Sick dark movie but actors did their part well,"This is a dark, depressing and psychopath movie. I am not surprised by many +ve reviews as these kind of movies are liked by a section of people. Just did not imagine so many people are in that section.Simply put in one sentence , this is a manifestation of a writers and directors sick, perverted , violent and dark mind, venting their inadequacies.I believe movies are meant for relaxation, entertainment and appreciation of art. This movie does just a little bit appreciation for art, Acting of Ranbir, Rashmika, Anil Kapoor and may be Sunny Deol too is very good. Nothing much else to take from this.",negative
1,Shame in Indian films,"A few years ago, during my college days, ""Arjun Reddy"" was overhyped. However, after watching the film, I realized it wasn't worth the time I spent on it. According to the director, a man can do anything, regardless of whether it's right or wrong, while a woman should obediently follow her male partner. This perspective suggests that a woman can be considered a modern feminist only if she conforms to certain expectations and surrenders her voice and rights. Moreover, she is portrayed as having no agency in choosing her boyfriend. If a boy displays negative behavior towards her, she is expected to fall in love with him and comply with his wishes, irrespective of her own feelings. Initially, I thought the director, Mr. Sandeep Reddy Vanga, might have chosen this subject matter by mistake. However, after watching the trailer for ""Animal"" and considering the public's response, I have decided not to watch any films directed or produced by Sandeep Reddy Vanga in my lifetime. I don't understand why people praise such a film that I find worthless.",negative
10,Unlike anything you've seen!!,"What a movie! What a star! Ranbir Kapoor you're the best..!! None of the other actors can ever match up to the powerhouse RK is! All other movies - Pathan, War, Tiger - Shahrukh, Salman, Hritik nothing and no one can match up to this movie.. And Sandeep Reddy Vanga.. what story telling..! Bobby Deol..yet another powerhouse performance..What an action sequence - never before seen avatar of Ranbir Kapoor.. this is yet another unforgettable movie and performance from Ranbir Kapoor.A movie to be experienced in theatre.. so many moments, high points, excellence in cinema.. background music is at a different level.. long movie but worth every minute.. don't leave the theatre without watching the post end credits.",positive
9,Different and Refreshing!,"I went in with zero expectations and sat through a 3.5 hour movie without touching my phone. The plot was truly refreshing. I am tired of seeing the classic heroic Bollywood movies where the hero can never be wrong. Vanga truly uncovers a beast.Ranbir Kapoor is shown to be an ""animal"", with some signs showing in his childhood and teenage years but really unraveling in his adulthood after a major incident. From then on, what Ranbir does is beyond imaginable. Ranbir is not shown to be a hero - he does barbaric things, goes back on his words, and doesn't respect anyone in his life. Folks who are crying about Ranbir's role really think all movie heroes are to be admired.Everyone's acting was phenomenal. Bobby Deol was GREAT, what a comeback. The interval sequence was a pleasure to watch, even though I am usually not a big fan of large action sequences. The music is great.I just wish the second half was not as dragged. I am not a big fan of Tripti Dimri's sequence. It was unnecessary and only added for the sequel. It is also funny that there is no sign of a police offer or law enforcement throughout the movie despite all the violence. But overall this was a refreshing movie. Must watch!",positive
1,Very bad movie,Worst movie. No storyline. Just trying to glorify toxic masculinity and violence. The character of ranbir kapoor is just a psychologically ill person who has been glamourized as a hero. The whole movie just contain bloodshed. Movie is just trying to justify the aggresive behavior and cheating. This movie is just trying to justify the violence toward women cheating bloodshed by calling them alpha male. One after another there are more violent scene in the movie without any need. Rashmika character is not very significant. There whole love life is trying to potray bad behavior toward women as love.,negative
7,Great cinematic experience but problems with what it represents,"This movie is cinematically so great. Well acted, scenes full of emotion, well edited, good cameos and also good action scenes. Overall great experience to watch in threater. Do not think it will be same feeling in OTT.It does represent alpha male concept as every one is talking. But one thing I would say is it does not try to glorify that. While watching movie we all feel like Ranbir is psycho obsessed with his father and also as a viewer it does not try to convince me that it is write for what Ranbir did. I still feel like Ranbir was wrong at so many level and did so many wrong things. I did not feel glorified. Movie trying to compare alpha male concept with animal instinct and not saying it should be normal human. We have evolved so much like human and we act differently but in parallel universe if we were like animal we would act like in the movie. I think that is what movie is trying to say.",positive
10,Totally worth my ticket money,"Salute to Sandeep vanga Reddy for perfect execution of his thinking. It literally give you goosebumps. Story and it's portray on screen was awesome. You don't seen hooting and clapping from multiplex audience but here ranbeer kapoor pulled his act so perfectly with Sandeep direction. A must watch on a theatre to feel that sensation. Also support cast pulled their part so good. Some feminist call it ultra male ego but it show you was men are. The character of Vijay is ruthless but also have feelings for his family. While chasing his prey as an alpha it also show its use of mind instead of just some action like mindless South Indian film. Our protagonist is vulnerable physically and mentally. It get consicunses of its action in form of operation and loss of hearing. But his nature compelling his to do what he want to. Also his instinct not wrong and proved right when it happens. Ahead of all other he is much smarter, powerful and ahead of his time every occasion.",positive
4,Okayish with alot of elements that fall under misogyny,"Just watched the show today. The overall script was going well. But i expected that the script will show stories revolving around other characters. It just felt like that the script just highlighted Ranbir's role and others were sidelined.The entire cast acted well. Kudos to them.But the director and the script writer could've made more sense.Script portrayed women as weak, a sex toy and being played around just for pleasure. It shows alot of elements that supports man over women. 0 equality.Thou as the name of the movie is "" Animal "" it all sets in with its title.NOT AT ALL FOR KIDS.",negative
5,"Waste of time, same old masala in new packet","This movies is dull and boring. The movie's premise is idiotic and the execution is as disappointing.I am not going to say anything about misogyny and toxicity here as crying all day about it is as cringe as this movie.The movie suffers from a lack of character development, plot coherence, and thematic depth.Ranbir can act well but when story is garbage, he can't do much.The story is repetitive and predictable, with no surprises or twists. This formula is used multiple times and is becoming unbearable now.The movie's only redeeming quality is its action sequences which were fun to watch.Overall a one time watch if you have 3 hours to waste and nothing else to do.",negative
7,K3G gone rogue,"Watching this movie was a marathon session, half a day almost gone from the time we left home, watched the movie nearby and came home.. The basic premise is from K3G, where papa and son have a problem .. However in the older movie they solved problems diplomatically and weeping inconsolably, while here it's done with guns and knives..There's also a (cousin) brother who plays an evil contrast to the kind hearted sissy in the original version.The movie belongs to Ranbir Kapoor.. Here's someone who looks good, and acts extremely well. The BGM, and massy template is excellent.. The post credit scene alone is worth half the price of the ticket..Overall, great entertainment ..",positive
10,Animal: A Cinematic Masterpiece Setting New Standards in Bollywood,"Animal"" is not just a film; it's a revolution in the Indian cinema landscape. Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga has outdone himself, crafting a narrative so gripping and visually stunning that it transcends the typical boundaries of Bollywood. His direction is both bold and sensitive, a rare combination that elevates the film to an art form.The heart and soul of ""Animal"" is Ranbir Kapoor. His performance is nothing short of phenomenal, capturing the complexities of his character with depth and nuance. Kapoor proves yet again why he is regarded as a new-age superstar. His ability to convey intense emotions with subtle expressions is a testament to his unmatched acting prowess.What sets ""Animal"" apart is its fearless approach to storytelling. It pushes the boundaries of conventional Bollywood cinema, charting new territories in terms of narrative and character development. The film sets a high bar for the industry, challenging other filmmakers to break free from traditional molds.In essence, ""Animal"" is a game-changer. It's not just a film; it's a bold statement about the future of Bollywood. It's a reminder that Indian cinema is capable of producing world-class content. ""Animal"" is a must-watch, not just for its exceptional storytelling and performances but for its contribution to evolving the landscape of Bollywood cinema.",positive
2,NOT WORTH YOUR TIME,"The teaser & trailer of this movie were very promising. But the movie itself is painfully mediocre. Sandeep Reddy Vanga, the director couldn't justify the runtime of more than 3 hour 30 minutes. The movie is paced very slow. While its not an inherently bad thing to pace the movie slow, the movie doesn't even try to provide depths to its characters. Every character is as one-dimensional as it comes. The director has tried to potray ranbir's character as an egotistical pretty boy with sociopathic tendencies but due to the sheer incompetence of the director, the character feels like an annoying manchild. Ranbir has done a good job considering the material he was handed. Same cannot be said about other characters. Rashmika has given a hard-to-watch performance. The packed theatre in Melbourne where I watched this movie was filled with laughter and giggles everytime Rashmika tried to pull off an intense/emotional scene. The writing of this movie is a mess. In one scene, protagonist might be laughing and joking with his buddies and in another scene he might start arguing with either his father or wife without a buildup of any kind. The dialogues are full of sexual innuendos which might make any teenager laugh hysterically but it will make any adult with brain cringe hard. The editing is very choppy. Even with its long runtime, the movie will not give you a second to soak up a scene. This is not a violent movie either as told by the director many times. Sandeep Reddy Vanga is a mediocre director, a subpar writer and an incompetent editor and he chose to prove this right in this movie.",negative
8,Animal: A Cinematic Spectacle with Flaws in its Wild Ride\,"Sandeep Reddy Vanga, known for his knack for controversial yet compelling narratives, strikes again with ""Animal,"" a film that mirrors his signature style of blockbuster success paired with polarizing critiques. The story revolves around Ranvijay Balbir Singh, portrayed by a captivating Ranbir Kapoor, whose intense loyalty to his father, played by the evergreen Anil Kapoor, leads to a trail of vengeance that leaves the audience questioning the price of familial devotion.The technical aspects of the film deserve applause, serving as a masterclass in sound editing, cinematography, action sequences, set design, dialogue, and music. Each frame is a visual treat, and the ability to generate hype surrounding the film is unparalleled, making it a noteworthy case study for cinephiles.Ranbir Kapoor's performance stands out as one of his finest, showcasing a depth and intensity that harks back to his debut in 2007. Anil Kapoor, at 67, continues to charm with his on-screen presence, proving that age is no barrier to delivering a compelling performance. However, Rashmika Mandanna falls short of expectations, struggling with Hindi pronunciation and delivering a performance that feels incongruent with her capabilities. Tripti Dimri shines in her supporting role, while Bobby Deol continues his impressive streak, dominating the screen with his commanding presence.The supporting cast, including Shakti Kapoor in a refreshing role, Sourabh Sachdeva, and Kawalpreet Singh, contribute significantly to the film's narrative. Notable performances come from Suresh Oberoi, Prem Chopra, Babloo Prithiveeraj, and Upendra Limaye, adding depth to their supporting roles.Yet, amidst the cinematic brilliance, ""Animal"" falls prey to its shortcomings. The excessive violence overshadows the narrative, leaving the audience craving a more balanced storytelling approach. Some scenes border on the over-the-top, and a more concise editing could have elevated the overall viewing experience. The film's director, Sandeep Reddy Vanga, known for his controversial public persona, might be a divisive figure yet again, with some suggesting he could benefit from staying out of the spotlight.In the midst of the film's triumphs and tribulations, ""Animal"" emerges as a cinematic spectacle with undeniable flaws. While it leaves an indelible mark with its technical prowess and standout performances, a more refined narrative approach could have elevated it from a wild ride to a storytelling masterpiece.",positive
10,Badaasss bollywood movie of 2000s,"For those who are hating this movie , go watch those flop movies of sharukh and Salman
Dialogues were good , the action was badass and the background music were like woww.Ranbir Kapoor stuns you with the most complex character, and your jaw will be dropped with shock and awe for his mind boggling acting along with various emotions stampede. He just tears open the cinema screen with his brilliance and ease, as he transforms from a raging teenager to animal man, and there is no stopping even with a meteor.This marks him as the best actor of Indian cinema with a launchpad to reach the elites.Having to match him is no easy feat but Rashmika Mandanna does it elegantly with stubbornness and guts.Anil Kapoor is a class apart with his stature and maturity.Bobby Deol is back with a bang. He delivers his career best performance although his screen presence is very short (a bit disappointing).The story is uniquely presented with full heart and woven really well with astounding screenplay and terrific music.And those who oftenly watch Hollywood like me, go watch this movie . It is epic
Blockbuster by Sandeep Reddy Vanga sir.",positive
1,Horrible,"Started watching yesterday and writing the review in between...Sandeep wanga has portrayed himself through the lead actors in the movies like animal and Kabir Singh. I saw him speaking in an interview ""If i can't slap my partner then what sort if love is this"". The short of characters he has in his movies doesn't deserve to be any short of society and yet he justified it. Javed Akhtar's viral video in which he tells what a hero is in a movie. ""A hero is reflection of the society or what the society aspire to be"". Since the charater isni reflection of society so it should be what society aspires to. And being this film a hit is huge red flag.",negative
10,Best of December,Excellent movie with action sequences and songs. Ranbir kapoor at his best shining all the way and would like to see more of Bobby deol. One of the best movies I have seen this December. The post credit scene is worth it.Vanga has created a masterpiece many may think it's not worth your time but it is trust me. I can see the awards coming in already. Bgm was exceptional too hyped or gave the enigma that was needed in the scenes.Good and crisp editing would have made the film much more better. Supporting cast was also good but the bond between the father and son was good greatly captured . All the best for future projects.,positive
9,Feral Instincts - Animal,"This is an unabashed ode to all wily teenagers out there who think they can conquer the world and never grow past that phase. This reminds me of the now cult dialogue from Sacred Games - 'Kabhi kabhi lagta hain apun hi yaha ka bhagwan hain' - loosely translated to - sometimes I feel that everyone else is subservient to me here. The translation doesn't have any of the emotions the antagonist playing protagonist in the series is trying to convey. It is akin to having well seasoned food while down with Covid wherein taste buds have bid adieu.Sandeep (Director) has been a maverick and a good one at that. I would say a good one because his ideas seems to resonate with a large set of people. Anyone can decide to wander off the beaten path but being successful at that is another ball game altogether. Most of us are trained to suck the wages drip and get a temporary high. I, for one, would like nothing better than break the hamster in a wheel monotony.Movie is a directors canvas and the colour palette and the subject choice is what piques our interest. In some cases, goodwill or past work precedes the quality. For example, you would have a great opening only from curiosity, for bigger and famed directors, as they have proved their mettle and have an almost impeccable track record. I never understood the grandiose settings for Dunkirk and yet I gracefully stayed off critiquing it, assuming that my humble IQ prevented me from getting the essence of what the genius director was trying to portray.Ranbir's post teen intro starts off with Rahman's music rehashed and we immediately are transported to 90-2000's, somehow I could draw parallel to my younger days wherein I was one of the few without two left feet. Innocent, innocuous and oft shy of attention but dance floor never scared me and that's where I found myself.At its very core, this is a love story but in tragedy genre. A son yearns for forbidden love and the thirst remains unquenched inspite of the vagaries in his life.The standouts for the movie in order are - Ranbir, BGM, Action Choreography and Novelty factor, music and weird screenplay. While other points are self explanatory, weird screenplay may need some clarification. Sandeep either allows for normal run of the mill situation to etch itself on the movie reel or creates situation so fanatic that its imagination may find its origination back to an insane yet beautiful mind.Coming to the superstar, I once remember that Shah Rukh in an interview stated that he is last of the stars and I had no reason to doubt that. Now I do, Ranbir who always possessed that 'x' factor never outshone his blue blood predecessors but here he is flipping middle finger to the industry who had but ruled him as down and out post multiple failures. I could imagine his plight that in spite of all honesty and sheer brilliance, he was still not making the elite list and was overshadowed by much lesser actors. I am ecstatic that he has arrived and as a SuperStar. If this is fanboyism, proud to do just that.The movie has splattered the canvas with shades of crimson and I love it. Gore needs to be treated with respect else it feels dastardly. Ranbir spreading his arms like a bald eagle with knife in his hands is a sight to behold and this is when he is smeared in blood.The casting is just top notch, everyone including Ranbir's entourage fit the bill. It is a bespoke choice. There are multiple high points in the movie and it keeps you hooked for the most parts. The trailer showed us one of the beautiful intimate encounter wherein both characters are at their most vulnerable. How often do you find yourself in a situation wherein you are not wrong and you didn't yield but that had negative results in the future. Don't equate this with ego.Of the things, I would change - extended romantic \ marital Discord scenes and Kashmir song. However the post credit scene explains the significance of the first criciticsm partly. Also I would genuinely like to have Bobby grab my eyeballs for just that little bit extra. The Powerpoint like transition is his intro and it is followed by Jamal Jamaloo song, something we don't understand but can groove to. From here, we are made aware of his feral instincts almost immediately. He is fierce, untamed but has intense love being conveyed almost deceptively through his eyes. I now see Bobby with renewed respect, for the actor he is and more so for the human he seems to be. Definitely a phoenix in the film industry. Special mention to Rashmika and Anil Kapoor, they have dug deep and come out all aces. The scene wherein Rashmika was grinding her teeth found its way to crass memes upon release of the trailer. In the movie, it is one of the best monologues delivered with utmost conviction. She stands tall in front of the towering personality and literally trades punches when due. Anil Kapoor does what he does best, laden with confidence plays a character that cannot easily be loathed.Love the lyrics of the B Praak song and could wish that I had little more courage to stand for what I really am. The climax is thrilling followed by a Tsunami of emotions and then back to the original theme - it leaves you on tenterhooks, maybe for next 3-4 years.Loved the experience and yes, the wait was worth it.",positive
10,Unbelievable violence,"Animal is a movie which gives an immersive experience with fluent storytelling interspersed with scenes of 'over-the-top' violence that stretch for several minutes together. We need not believe any part of the story, but rather be entertained by whatever transpires on the screen for over 3 hours, including high voltage dialogue delivery to portray emotional relationships, moments of adult comedy and innuendos and unrestrained bloodshed in various degrees of rawness. That such a long duration movie did not feel that long certainly means one thing, and which is that it is engrossing by virtue of superb acting by all the actors who played the various characters. Indeed, Ranbir Kapoor portrays an Animal. I wonder what kind of animals will be featured in Animal Park.",positive
2,Off target movie with counterfeit character arc,"During a marathon duration of 3 hours and 21 minutes, laden with intense gore, heightened testosterone levels, and overt misogyny, the film unfolds an onslaught of brutal violence, hypermasculine themes, and unabashedly sexist undertones, creating an atmosphere that is both physically and emotionally draining for the audience. The relentless display of bloodshed, machismo, and gender bias throughout the movie contributes to an experience that may be challenging for viewers seeking a more nuanced or balanced narrative.The Bloodshade I can understand but treating women like they are objects is very disappointing to watch.Actions sence were better and at some instinct BGM is also applaudable and one more thing the storyline is so typical and predictable.Overall it's a disappointng movie.",negative
3,Absolute dog water movie.,"Unlike other movies by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, this movie has the tiniest bit of entertainment. While his other movies are unwatchable, this one you can can force yourself to watch it one time.Also to note, gun shot noises and how many shots that were actually taken was not in rhythm in multiple parts of the film. No recoil in the guns they shoot. Ranbir gets shot and stabbed with an axe at one point but next scene the back of his shirt is clean. (idk how they miss this in a massive movie like this)The first one hour is very stretched for no reason, ie. The backstory was very unnecessarily long. The fight in the middle of the movie was also stupidly excessive. But then looking back at it, the first half was way better than the second. So you can imagine how bad the rest of the movie was.Essentially a very overrated movie (below average at best), very good acting, a few new elements not seen in bollywood, story leads to nothing (director is a professional at this)The idea of the movie was excellent but the way it was executed was absolutely horrible. Obviously it is a comeback compared to his previous films, that is because it cant get any worse from Arjun Reddy.",negative
10,This movie is just burn some people's ass🤣,People are saying that this movie is insane because of violence 🤣🤣 if violence make a movie bad then game of thrones is also bad. Also other 6969 top rated and famous movie are also bad. If you can't handle violence then just don't watch it don't talk bad about it. And people who are thinking from the trailer that this is mainly about father son relationship and anil Kapoor and the others don't get the spotlight then for them to know this movie is all about Ranbir Kapoor and the full story is build up what he is thinking happening and nothing else. The reason we don't see much things about father son relationship because Ranbir Kapoor thinks that he Don't get much time with anil Kapoor.,positive
1,An utter waste of time,"It is a ridiculous movie which makes you question the mental state, wellbeing, of Indian society for writing, making and accepting this movie and making it a blockbuster. It has utterly flouted religious minorities culture, misrepresented them. It is brainless bloodshed and the only question it leaves in my mind is how is it acceptable to put such trash on tv and make it a super hit?Artistic democracy is on one side and cultural appropriation on another, how in this day and age, with all the information resources, such nonsense comes to life with clear misrepresentation. This movie is misogynistic has only been made to show how easy it is to get away with throwing shade at such groups.I want to point out, it was problematic showing objects of religious significance used by Sikhs for representations used as weapons and then performing a religious right of another religion which is not promoted on Sikhism.",negative
10,Mind blowing,Didn't expect from Ranbir at first but after watching the movie seriously I came to know that he will sure break all the records of bollywood .... The two Ranbir and rashmika both's acting are so real no words to express.... And comeback of Bobby Deol is also so good if some one comes back it should be like the one which Bobby is doing.... Waiting for the next one. Will watched for sure... The bond between father and son it clearly shows to the people how u should be with a son and father. The last part when anil kapoor realised that he should treat his son and apologize that really touched my heart. A son which Ranbir is taking care of his father that's how people need to learn.,positive
1,What the heck was that,"Believe me, this is my first movie review ever and I have taken time to create account and all so you can think what I did to make sure I atleast contribute something so that such people will not be given a chance to direct a movie ever. The guy will rot somewhere in his later years. Youth will make you do stupid things and get away with it as you have strong body and all. But this creep will die a slow death. What the heck was that? Movie? What you wanted to show? What was going through your mind? Is this how you want to show family/relations/love? Is this how you were treated in your childhood. You need to see a good doctor man. If anyone is telling you differently, please get away from them. I wanted to give negative rating, but can't.

Bloody, full of violence, sex. Though it wont last for long.Gives a very bad message.Honestly this movie should have been banned.Not for family and kids to watch.😡 😡😡😡😡",negative
6,Subtle important message!,"A movie that delivers what could be expected from its teasers. There is clear but veiled message running parallel along a violent and mysogynistic plot. A message that the characters as well as the plot is not anything near life, they are unwanted filth that needs to be socially discarded. It takes a heartless, miserable father to raise a monster, an animal out of a son. A father who cares for every goddamn business in the world, but not his son. An unheard child raised under tyranny of parents becomes a devil, an undesired outcome of ignorance and negligence. Even a proud father will hate a product of his own creation, slaying the world around him, for nothing but false pride and worthless honour. Neither those father, nor such sons are good for a society, polity or economy.The carry away moral of the story is that don't be such a father or a son, as depicted by characters beautiful play by Ranbir Singh and Bobby Deol. Their animalistic lust and madness runs up and down their family line. Love, faith and cooperation is the way out of this violence and misery. But, I wonder how many will take this moral out of the theatres to the real world?I am afraid that most of will carry an animalistic desire and filthy list out into the world. Because, the message in favour of life lies deep beneath the layers of violence and sex scenes. Few will get to the message of love and importance of a father and education on their children. We live in a socially wretched wrecked neighbourhood. We need to pet our animals and control those animalistic wages that breaks a family and creates an animal to be death with in our everyday interactions. The direction and cinematography are indeed praise-worthy. Keeping in mind that the subtle pro-life message is too deep within the story lines and scenes created, I would not give it a rating more than 7, so I guess 6 will be appropriate in this content.",negative
10,Amazing!Not everyones piece of cake.,"This is not a movie but an emotion in itself. Hard to justify in words and not everyone will understand it. Sandeep Reddy Vanga has nailed it. Father son emotion at its peak. Ranbir has finally did a role that suited him the best. He has evolved as an actor probably the best product that could come out of Nepotism.The action sequence before the interval is the best ive ever seen, specially with the background scope matching every beat with the action. That whole sequence is out of the world. Not meant for all surely. People with strong opinions might have mixed feelings about the movie. Go with open mind and accept it's just a character. This movie has an evolving story that kept gripping the multiple timelines direction worked out amazingly well.",positive
1,I'd give this a Zero if I could. Utter tasteless trash.,"Just an absolute waste of time. Nothing makes any sense. Why is the protagonist the worst character in the film? Not compelling, intelligent, cunning, engaging. Just utterly boring. The worst part is it had potential between the actors, music, budget, cinematography. But the script and story which is meant to be dark, deep, mature, and haunting is just senselessly tasteless, pretentious, needlessly complicated, and incoherent. Don't know if the intention behind this story got lost in translation, but whatever the case, what a trainwreck and dumpster fire. Funny how much Bollywood can get away with on the basis of style and one big name star.",negative
1,Horrible and Non Sensical,"Horrible movie - glorifies mindless violence - story makes no sense. There seems to be a trend of creating sensational stuff just for the sake of it - big responsible actors need to understand and disengage with this kind of cinema.The movie leaves you disgusted with a bad after taste - utterly useless. Mind numbing violence is not good cinema. Zero sensitivity.What is the message by the director / actors? Just trying to bend your wind with convoluted storyline, violence, needless action, unsavoury cinema. Does not deserve even a zero rating. Total bakwaas bekaar movie - wastage of time.

10,ANIMAL (2023) - A Riveting Cinematic Experience,"An extraordinary film, brimming with emotions that delve deep into the powerful bond between a father and a son. Disregard any misleading comments about violence or lack of plot; this movie is far from the stereotypes. Instead, it beautifully portrays the profound love a son holds for his father, exploring the intensity of that relationship.In an era where Bollywood has transitioned from innocent boy-girl romances to more complex narratives like 'Murder' and intense love stories like 'Arjun Reddy' or 'Kabir Singh,' we seldom see portrayals of the love and passion between a father and son. ""ANIMAL"" steps into this uncharted territory, initiating with raw emotions and concluding on the same note.The film masterfully captures passion at various levels, not shying away from intense scenes. It's a cinematic journey that mirrors life - full of emotions, breathtaking action sequences, and impactful dialogue delivery.

7,You know what you are in for!,"A mistake is human and here there were drawbacks such as underuse of Bobby Deol(Abrar) but they(mistakes) were not alone as goods outweigh them. Let's talk one by one on them:Pros
1. Acting
The acting by the cast is just superb and not a single character does less than perfect.2. Change
Talking about change, it shows the Ranvijay's character's boon slowly turning into poison and him repelling the things once he loved.3. Story
There is not much story but the same story is presented in such a way that you never feel it as a clichè.4. Emotions
One of the important aspects of a movie is the feelings and while watching this you have plenty. There are many scenes where you are pumped up while there are also scenes where our heart sank.5. Songs
Needless to say the songs in the movie like Jamal Kudu, Papa Meri Jaan etc were satisfying their roles and your mind at the same time. In other words, they were fantastic .Cons
1. Loose Story
As said earlier, there is not much to think about the story.2. Underuse of Bobby
If I explain, it will be a spoiler.3. A little bit long
The movie should have been at least 10 minutes shorter as many find it difficult to sit in thetres that long and though the movie didn't lose complete grip of audience, it nearly slipped from their hands in the middle.Overall the movie is good, enjoyable and fun. It is just a start to a new genre in Indian Cinema and hence the mistakes can be neglected. Moreover, if you complain that the movie is violent or has unnecessary violence or disrespect women then just remember you have heard these things from the director himself so you shouldn't expect that you will not get that in the theatres.",positive
1,This Movie Will Ruin Today's Youth,"I was walking in the market when I heard some people say that Animal movie was so good. And came across yt shorts claiming it's a father and son love movie. I will just say, it's a trash movie. Yeah the acting was good but it doesn't really mean anything when u act good but the script is a disaster and have u all seen the intimate scenes. This is just a disaster. This movie shows male lead as an alpha male when in reality it's just a man cheating. Really these movies should not be supported. Ranbir Kapoor really had to come naked on set. Bollywood is destroying the youth of this country.......",negative
1,Disastrous,"Disappointed in everyone who worked on this flim, younger generation get traumatised for life when they see things like this, in what way is the director and crew trying to convey a message to its user
The story could have been conveyed better with better appropriate screening, The directors vision and direction is only becoming worse and worse film by film
This movie purely inspires people to behave like animals, act selfish we did not evolve and pass many civilisations to go back into living like animal.This film should never have been approved by the film board even an 18+ rating is not enough.",negative
10,A master piece..hats off,"Whatever narrow minded people say doesn't matter. Criticising is easy, appreciation need guts..and depth. Extraordinary father son bonding .. Oscar level action by Ranbir and Director..keep it up Sandeep...The Trend Setter.. enough of goody goody meaningless films...we need more from Sandeep.My only point was Deepika kind of actress would have taken it to different heights than Rashmika, though she tried her best to withstand Ranbir's Tsunamical action.. how Ranbir left all these skills all these days..it is in his blood and atheist offlate he shook Indian cinema, like his Grandfather Great RajKapoor ji.",positive
8,Good movie despite second half lag,"The film delivers powerful performances by Ranbir Kapoor and Rashmika, complemented by a captivating BGM that enriches each moment. Sandeep Reddy's emotional direction, coupled with Anil Kapoor's strong support, enriches the narrative. Despite a lag in the second half, exceptional acting from Deol counterbalances it, while Tripti's impressive debut adds a fresh charm. The movie stands out with commendable visual effects and natural performances across the board, leaving a lingering desire to revisit it for its compelling storytelling and standout acting moments. Should watch movie. Go and enjoy in theatres.",positive
2,Work of Insane minds.....,"Messy and sick mind the director has, that he made such an irresponsible and irrelevant movie.... Machoism and action is enjoyable but the unwarranted awkwardness in many scenes and excessive unrealistic action is no artistic work but reflection of a sick mind.Very poor and botched up movie which can have extremely bad effect on social fabric as art makes micro/nano changes but they are deep, wide and permanent.Was unable to enjoy the action and adult scenes even alone, can imagine the awkwardness it would create in a group.Shame that such movies are made and are commercially viable, encourages others to invest in the gerne. Lost respect for every actor to accept, act and promote such a movie.",negative
1,Animal: A Disappointing Dive into Bollywood's Clichés,"Recently had the opportunity to watch the 2023 Bollywood film ""Animal,"" and I must say, it was an utter disappointment. Expecting an evening of entertainment, I convinced my friends to join me, only to regret it deeply. The movie, with its three-hour duration, was an exhaustive ordeal with little to no engaging content. The storyline was disjointed and seemed to lack any logical structure, making it hard to follow or invest in the plot.The performances, especially by the lead actors, were underwhelming. Ranbir Kapoor, despite his previous successes, failed to deliver a convincing role, and Rashmika Mandanna's acting was far from compelling. Their characters lacked depth and believability, rendering the emotional scenes ineffective.However, the film wasn't entirely devoid of talent. Bobby Deol's dance sequence was a surprising highlight, showing a glimmer of skill in an otherwise dreary movie. His performance brought a brief moment of enjoyment to an otherwise tedious viewing experience.So, It was disheartening to see such potential wasted on a movie that neither entertains nor enlightens. As the credits rolled, my friends and I were left with a sense of regret for the time lost, a sentiment echoed by many others in the audience. This film, unfortunately, is not one I would recommend, except perhaps for Bobby Deol's commendable dance performance.",negative
7,Raw intense and completely violent,"You either love this movie or hate this movie to core..i liked this movie but this isn't a best film
If you loved arjun reddy then you can go for it but uf you hate that film don't ever go near this film.... Just like the director said this is a violent film yes it is.The film is all about a father and son relationship but in a twisted way the first half was nicee with so many massive moments especially the pre intervel scenes but the 2nd half was completely messed up by toxic masculinity sexualizing women and unnecessary scenes and weak villain. The runtime was maybe one of the major drawback beacuse the total film is 3ndhalf hours the first half was 2 hours but i really didn't felt any lag but the second half can be trimmed. But the climax was worth don't miss the post credit scene.Ranbeer kapoor was the main positive of the film he was living as the psychotic character he is really a super star. Anil kapoor rashmika was also nice but bobby deol was fire but the character doesn't create any impact due to the less screen time tripti dimri wasted her talent for this film. Bgm,music cinematography and everything was nice. Srv's direction was great but he really added so many scenes only to make the critics criticise because he told in an interview that he will make the critics make this film criticise and he challenged the critics we can see that it so many scenes.So animal is completely a raw,intense film can be watch if you are a fan of srv or ranbeer kapoor. If toxic masculinity unwanted sexual abuse towards women violence is okay to you then go for it.",positive
1,Cannot give 0 so giving 1.... Create hype and movie hit... pathetic movie no story,"It's a shame how the Bollywood industry is creating hype around movies that lack any real substance. Superstars like SRK with Pathan, and now this - it's no wonder people are losing faith in the industry. Actors should be ashamed of themselves for participating in projects that have no real content, message, or story to tell. It's all just meaningless sequences and gore. To any actors out there, especially Ranbir or SRK, please stop doing films like this. We deserve better and we should demand better.You should provide a Disprin tablet with these movies... I also do not understand how people tolerate it in theater... Do us a favor and do not make Animal 2.",negative
10,Loved the action and love for family,"Just Watched Animal, Hold the Breath. It's a BLOODSHED BLOCKBUSTER...Ranbir's daring & dashing performance never seen in screen before. Just nailed the role! He is really a versatile actor. He did this with so intensity. Bobby Deol is in beast mode. Rashmika got a decent role. This is a masterpiece by SandeepReddyVanga and Ranbir Kapoor which will remain in everyone's heart for years and years...
Also loved the story of how you can go to any extent to protect family and the love for father the music is so charging also waiting for secong part now which i can imagine can be so brutal, lets see.",positive
3,Felt bad experience,"So excited & thought it was interesting movie but failed all expections &hope after watching, worst movie experience felt after 2nd half of movie seen storyline improper need to end before only climax after holding his son but unnecessary lagging to violence end note.good scenes there between wife husband love bond but more than that violence distrubing relations bonds abuse scenes all negative aspects.he says his brothers they were he bring from their place,bond they have but finally he kills them by himself for fault reason completely madman picture, flim psycho person behaviour what is unbelievable is with mad person he has gang friends family.",negative
1,Created an IMDb account to tell everyone how horrible this movie is.,"No I am giving out any spoilers, because I couldn't watch the movie beyond 20 mins. I tried twice.It is not even worth analysing the movie and calling out the misogyny. That isn't even my problem with what I saw. It is just so bad!The dialogues sound like they were written by a school kid.No coherence between one scene and the next. Absolute rubbish. The background music is absolutely random.The director tries to throw in all the concepts in his mind into the dialogues randomly, and it makes no sense. From what an Alpha is to Happiness is a decision.Absolute piece of garbage. India, wtf?",negative
10,Only those like the movie who have a good taste in flims,"I'm literally so annoyed by the people who are giving hate to this masterpiece...i mean it's been soo long since I've watched such a good Bollywood movie.people who say this movie is giving wrong context to young people..bruh seriously? The movie was never meant to show Ranbir as a good person as a hero NOO the movie only wanted to give one message that ""HOW BAD PARENTING REFLECTS ON YOUR CHILD IN FUTURE"" bad perenting seriously have a very bad affact on young generation and it was high time to make a movie on it...and movie with such comedy and action like so great...these people watch American series and movies which shows 10x of this is fine and entertaining to them but doesn't want it in India like bruh it's reality...we can't run away from affairs,murders,drugs many more thing happening in our country and making a movie on it was just to show we no longer live in satyuga... The whole context of this movie was that how parenting affect your child and how it can turn into an ANIMAL just to get a small attention and appreciation from them....that is the reason this movie is a hit..and people with brains and good movie taste will understand it.",positive
1,Completely cringe and terrible,"What happened Bollywood??? Everything about this movie was cringe worthy, try-hard, and pathetic. Would not recommend to anyone. No plot, acting, or substance. Dont know why or how they got ranbir kapokr for this role it's a glamorized low budget script.if u hate yourself and have 3hrs to waste then i encourage u to give the movie a shot. The south influence on bollywood needs to go because it's brought the movie quality down terribly low. Also the rashmika chick can't act to save her life i dont know what the purpose of creating this movie was so save your time please and watch a 2000s srk movie instead to remind yourself why you ever liked bollywood.",negative
2,"Very Long Movie, which faded after the first hour","The movie had a fantastic opening with ranbir childhood and his innocent love for his father, then his love story with rashmika, but as the brother in law came into picture the movie started to fade.I personally went into the movie knowing nothing about which I do for all the movies, this allows me th get the actual feel of the movie with having any preconceived notions.I personally felt there was a lot of unnecessary blood shed and the script was not written or portrayed well, I get the non linear story telling bit, but if the story or the potryal is not it self that great any way of story telling would not add anything to it.Also ofcourse the feminine part, as it is a Vanga movie I expected a purely non feminine movie and it was like that.Also there was no news of part two, as there is no real story it's just a massy movie with loud background scores, many many sex related references and nude scenes. For any one who enjoys logical movies like the recently came Oppenheimer you would absolutely hate this one.Lastly the movie was saved my the actors Ranbir, Rashmika, Anil Sir and all others great immersive acting and aslo the music breaks.",negative
1,Such a bad movie that I finally created an imdb account especially to review it.,"I have been a fan of Bollywood movies from my childhood which was in the 80s.I have watched the decline of classic Bollywood films over these recent years but now after watching this thing called 'Animal', and after seeing in utter shock and disbelief that it was nominated and won awards, I am convinced there is something extremely wrong in the Bollywood industry.I am shocked that such big names allowed themselves to take part in such a ridiculous movie which is a disgrace to Indian culture and Religions and shows no respect to them either.The amount of unnecessary and gory violence, and implied nudity and promiscuity reminded me of B rate movies.It lacked substance and many of the characters seemed like psychotic, unhinged and deranged humans.",negative
10,Great movie,"It's a great film to watch. The way director shows story it was very smooth. There are many layers in story but you don't get confused, so they done it smoothly. They could have done little more cuts to bring movie length under 3hrs. Great actions scenes. It's a violent film so just for adults, it's A certificate film, so it's not for kids ( I mentioned this because I read many reviews they disappointed because this film not for kids so). All actors done it great acting. Ranbir has become far better actor now. He has done it great work. I feel that this is his best work till date. After all It's just a movie, so they made it to enjoy little different cinema, so I enjoyed it while watching this movie. I recommend this to people, to go and watch.",positive
1,"A disgusting atrocity, zero stars!","This absolute disaster of a movie easily clinches a spot in the bottom 5 films I've ever subjected myself to. It's a train wreck of a narrative, drowning any semblance of storytelling in a sea of mindless violence and gratuitous sexuality that serves no purpose other than to shock. The complete lack of coherence or meaning makes it an exercise in frustration, leaving me more confused than ever about why this abomination was made. The actors, shamelessly taking on roles that should have come with a warning label, only add to the misery. Watching this film was akin to reliving the regrettable experience of enduring ""Rockstar"" by Ranbir Kapoor, a true testament to the depths of cinematic disappointment. Do yourself a favor and spare yourself from this excruciating journey into the abyss of terrible filmmaking.",negative
2,Only good thing was Ranbir Kapoor's acting,"One of the most horrible movie I have watched lately. No story line, bad editing, awkward cuts, weird dialogues and conversation. Apart from a couple of scenes the movie seemed like it had no connection and was just made without giving a thought. In spite of the movie being 3.4 hrs long it looked like the editor was not sure what and how to add parts to create the final version. Acting wise everyone except Ranbir was terrible. And what's wrong with the Indian movie scene seems like the dialogue and screenplay writers do not have anything to write. How is this movie making so much money is beyond my understanding.",negative
1,NO STORY MOVIE,"There is no proper story in this movie just sit and watch random scenes joined together violence is not the issue movie mein bas ek insaan logo ko Marta rahega apne papa ko bachane ke chakar mein or uske papa kuch nahi kahenge .....

10,Must watch,"It's certainly a long movie and ofcourse 18+
But this movie hits different. The vibe you feel in this movie is unmatchable. There is a lot of romance and adult talks but don't forget every character play its role with so much enthusiasm. Ranbir is at his best. After intermission they stretch it little long which was not needed but the first half just keep giving u goosebumps.There is a lot to learn from this movie for every relation. Ranbir's possessiveness for his father's love was so on point. Everyone did a good job. You can enjoy this movie with ur partner. Guys it's a must watch movie. ;)",positive
10,Master class !!!,"This is my first ever review since I joined in 2007. I walked out of watching Animal - First day first show !The film had a delirious effect on the audience in the theatre at large. I went through a gamut of emotions, from Sympathy to fear to an overwhelming sense of parenthood. I have a 9 year old son and today itself I scolded him before he left for school and I ended up weeping multiple times.A good film carries you along with you. A shoutout to the director; especially the way Sikhism has been hailed and presented. It took a director from the South to celebrate the valour of the Sikhs.It is always a treat to watch powerful actors performing powerful scenes together. Those scenes between Anil Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor have a lasting impact.The violence is shock inducing and raw. The action sequences and the Background score throws you into the depth of its pit.I am certain that this film will have me go again into the theatre.Two thumbs up from me.",positive
9,Animals in the world of Humans 🌍,"""Dive into a human-animal saga""🦁 Pulsating action, untamed emotions, and profound love. 1st half: heart-pounding pace. 2nd half slows,yet wraps up elegantly.

10,"Welcome to ""ANIMAL PARK""","Animal- The craziest and the most badass Indian movie that will ever be experienced by the audience on the screen so far since 110 years. Definitely falls under ""The Cult"" category.The boldest director Sandeep Vanga Reddy takes us through the journey of a Son's possessiveness towards his Dad to the volcanic extreme, that he is just replacing love with vengeance, peace with war, gentleness with rage and saneness with madness.Most of the scenes are original and never seen before.Ranbir Kapoor stuns you with the most complex character, and your jaw will be dropped with shock and awe for his mind boggling acting along with various emotions stampede. He just tears open the cinema screen with his brilliance and ease, as he transforms from a raging teenager to animal man, and there is no stopping even with a meteor.This marks him as the best actor of Indian cinema with a launchpad to reach the elites.Having to match him is no easy feat but Rashmika Mandanna does it elegantly with stubbornness and guts.Anil Kapoor is a class apart with his stature and maturity.Bobby Deol is back with a bang. He delivers his career best performance although his screen presence is very short (a bit disappointing).Tripti Dimra as Bhabi 2 was remarkable, I guess she was better than Rashmika. I want to see her back again in ""ANIMAL PARK""The story is uniquely presented with full heart and woven really well with astounding screenplay and terrific music.Strictly for 18+ years. The alpha man kicks in, with no good social message. Pure violence, rampage and massacre in parts.Wish some uncomfortable scenes were edited, and also movie duration trimmed (first part of second half) as its 3 hours 22 mins long.Animal movie cracks open the movie industry with the boldness and crookedness, and roars loud.A Must Watch!!!",positive
4,Did not live up to the expectation,"The film was over dramatic. Maybe the team was trying to create bollywood Kgf but they fall short on the budget and eventually compromised on their script, dialogues and screenplay. Ranbir was good but nothing new. Bobby deol was awesome but hardly visible in the film, he deserved to be seen more in the film. Unfortunately Rashmika's character did not connect us and her dialogue delivery was pathetic, producers should have opted for a bollywood actress. Anil Kapoor, Saurabh Sachdeva and Shakti Kapoor did their job very well. The movie would have worked better if it was edited more crisp, also the duration should have been 2 to 2.5 hours as the movie had a very personal and narrow issue to deal with. I believe bollywood has more potential in terms of acting and should focus more on the scripts and not compare ourselves with other film industries in our country.",negative
1,"Disgusting movie, Nothing other than violance and sex","There is literally no story. The character built up of all the casts is varying and confusing at every moment. At one point the actor behaves in one way, after few minutes he behaves completely differently. Unnecessary violence and sex where it was not required. The story shows the India as modern, capitalist republic country but there is no law and order present in the country. No police and no trials. Anyone can kill anyone without any accountability. Overall this is just waste of time, money. Above everything else, it's killer of the peace of mind. A toxic movie for the mind and for the society.",negative
10,Must Watch,"As December draws to a close, there's no doubt that ""Animal"" has clinched the title of the best movie of 2023. The anticipation was sky-high, fueled by the intriguing trailer that promised a powerful Father and Son bond. However, a word of caution to those planning a family outing - this movie is not for the faint-hearted, with its abundance of bold scenes that might catch you off guard.Now, let's dive into what truly makes ""Animal"" a cinematic triumph. The ensemble cast delivers a performance of the highest caliber, with each actor bringing their a game to the table. Ranbir Kapoors portrayal.",positive
7,Great Bgm Action Scene But Missing the core theme,"The way the movie starts it was very engaging. Tension between father son relationship..The core theme of the movie was tension between father son..Booby deol needed more screen time..Climax was not so powerful like that interval in 1st half..unnecessary post credit scene..I feel this movie should have ended in this part..unnecessary makers are trying to forcefully strech out the story..
The climax was confusing and all over the place..I think thats the reason i felt left out when i left the theatre..beginning mid part everything wqs going smooth..but the climax should have been more powerful and impactful the way movie was going..I felt incomplete.",positive
10,Rawest of 2023...!!,"Bro.. What was it!!! ..... Oo God!!! I got really mad after watching this masterpiece.. Every character was perfect but Ranbir was exceptionally good.. I had stopped watching bollywood films as all pictures are now based on earlier events and films.. So nothing fresh met us.... But this one is on next level... What a film mann... It is really damn good.. I have watched this film 2 times in 2 days and even when I hear the songs or tracks, every single moment of films comes in my mind and now I am really obsessed with this one... Thank you Sandeep Vanga sir for bringing such a masterpiece to us..",positive
5,Watch the movie is only for Ranbir & Bobby's actions !!,"The movie has not any Storyline, the movie contains with 'papa - papa' word many times so after watching this movie it's voice echoes in our ears sometimes.After watching the trailer, I thought that there will be more action scenes in this movie, but it was not that much.Rashmika mandanna doesn't have a good role in this movie.she disappointed us. She played a role only for kiss, she could not speak Hindi very well and she had not any emotions while talking with Ranbir Kapoor. There are many actresses in Bollywood movie instead of rashmika.The first half was filled with the actions of Ranbir Kapoor and After interval the movie goes in very boring mode but Bobby's acting brings out us from the boring mood.This movie is only one time watchable.",negative
7,"ANIMAL: An Artistic Expedition of Feelings, Genius, and Melodic Enchantment","Animal offers a gripping cinematic voyage, adeptly merging captivating guidance, formidable performances, and an energizing soundtrack. The initial section stands as a supreme demonstration in storytelling, with filmmaker Sandeep Reddy intertwining a fabric of emotions and tension. Ranbir Kapoor and Anil Kapoor shine, signaling a noteworthy return for Ranbir. Their on-screen chemistry deepens the storyline.Nevertheless, the latter part of the film loses momentum with a more leisurely pace, leaving the audience longing for the vigor of the opening scenes. Bobby Deol's restricted screen time misses an opportunity, as his presence might have enriched the storyline. Despite this, the exceptional performances enhance the film, especially Ranbir Kapoor's impactful portrayal.Rashmika Mandanna falls marginally below expectations, allowing space for improvement in her character portrayal. Shakti Kapoor, an experienced actor, could have had a more significant role to exhibit his talent.The music stands out as a striking feature, with Ajay-Atul's compositions crafting a captivating ambiance before the interval. B Praak's song during a pivotal fight sequence is a stroke of brilliance, displaying innovation in the film's soundtrack. Amit Roy's cinematography and Sundeep Reddy Vanga's editing substantially contribute to the film's overall allure.Extending over 201 minutes, the intricate storyline unravels with layers of familial dynamics, affection, deceit, and retribution. The post-credits scene lays the groundwork for potential sequels, adding an extra element of fascination for observant viewers.In conclusion, Beast offers a cinematic expedition worth witnessing despite its imperfections. The outstanding direction, remarkable performances, and unforgettable music make it a compelling addition to Indian cinema.",positive
2,Waste of money and time,"Awful film, what is the point of Ranbir's good acting if it doesn't contribute any value of significance to the film. Non-sensical and self-contradictory writing. For instance, the film in a scene, protagonist explains that in prehistoric era women used to choose alpha male and urges someone to pick an alpha male to get married and raise kids, and in another scene 2 min apart same protagonist preaches ""strong, independent women"". This kind of incoherent scenes and dialogues, Animal is filled with it. Which is then coupled with an immature editing. The film feels like video montages stitched together.The disrespect that the movie shows towards its audience is unfathomable. Complete waste of time and money.",negative

10,Good movie to watch,This is surely one of the best movies that bollywood has produced in the last 10 years in terms of entertainment. All things from storyline to music and from action scenes to quality of acting are brilliantly planned and executed. Even though the running time of the movie is almost 3.5 hours you actually don't feel its length.the acting level of rashimika is good .very good movie I love very much to watch.i request everyone to watch the movie. The movie screenplay is very good .The story is very good and also the movie has high good process of work.at last the movie is very good and please do watch the movie.,positive
4,Not the kind of movie that I expected; Facepalm for 3h 20min,"When I came to know Ranbir's Animal was being directed by SRV, I knew there would be some gore and toxic stuff. But compromising the story for all this is just insanity! With a wafer thin plot (which is inspired from Godfather - also not a movie of my liking), Animal is a mere revenge drama with an okayish screenplay but weak everything else.The dialogues and delivery are just so unnatural and cringe worthy. It seems awkard when random dialogues about human anatomy are thrown. The way characters speak in some scenes looks like it's also 'inspired' from some dull hollywood movies. Even the title card is badly displayed in a random scene when Ranbir is talking to his cousin.What more can be said?! I didn't like even a single scene from this film as this film gave me headache. I am happy that I didn't watch this in theatre, because this 3h 20min film is a torture even when watching on Netflix. If I had watched in theatre, I don't know whether I'd be in a situation to write this review, lol! ;-)",negative
6,Ranbir Kapoor drives this action saga.,"This has to be Ranbir Kapoor's best performance. Actions sequences are great to a point that they're setting up new standards for Bollywood. The background music is of top quality and adds a lot to the movie. The movie has a lot of scenes with high shock value which makes it engaging. All of the supporting cast did a great job as well with Anil Kapoor standing out as the regretful father.The movie could have been edited more and could have been 20 mins shorter without losing anything of value. Despite being this long, the movie hastily sets up Bobby Deol's character and doesn't give him meaningful screen time. The story of the movie was sort of ordinary. Many of the scenes/dialogue seem to be inserted only because they are controversial or just show extreme brutality and these scenes don't add anything of value to the movie.I see a lot of reviews criticizing the values of Ranbir's characters and downrating the movie because of that. It is important to note that Ranbir's character is not someone to be inspired from and learn your social values from. The movie is called ""Animal"" for a reason and those values are a net positive for the script.",negative
10,Awesome Cinematography in Bollywood,Now bollywood is recovering and producing quality content. It is one of the best blockbuster movie after sholay with loads of actions. Bobby Deol has performed outstanding and comeback with grand success while the Ranbir Kapoor with his animal look is fantastic. The cast is one of the best choice for this type of film. While it is intended to have aggressive scenes and all. Although the songs have become viral before the release of the movie itself tells us that the movie have already gained a huge fanbase. The director have done very good work. Overall the actions in the movie are super level.,positive
3,Disappointed,"#spoileralertAnimal the most anticipated movie if the year,which isn't worth the hype atleast for me.. technically no deep & captivating story line that can is connecting to audience..just a single emotion of father son bond showcased meaninglessly to justify unnecessary violence & makes it for forceful revenge drama. At a first place there is no father son bonding shown in the movie..there is no relationship building between the 2& even no proper reasoning for the constant tiff/ differences between the duo & also as the movie title is based on the main lead...good amount of screen time in his character building would have been extremely impacting..RKs character depicted is clumsy.Character at the end doesn't end up being either a Human or an Animal.The Love story is also purely rubbish. & Absolutely unrelatable.Bobby deol & Anil kapoor like sorted actors got nothing to do much.There is no character building of bobby, No proper introduction of the villian.The family rivalry story causing the wholesenseless violence has no base or depth... the screen time used for unnecessary introduction of Tripti dhimri & rashmika rks funny/weird/stupid dialogues could have been replaced by more of bobby &family rivalry back story for an impact. And most disappointing was the climax scene...especially the silly comedy dialogues whilst they r killing each other,B prak song in the background as if 2 separated brothers r not enemies but meeting after ages.. Post credit scene looked highly inspired fromVikram movie..""Surya's character....""Overall it looked like an extended version of Arjun Reddy with some mass elements with a Bollywood star..disappointed.",negative
10,Fantastic moive,"Full of action. There is a suspense every time. Eaching and every cast give there 100%. This is surely one of the best movies that bollywood has produced in the last 10 years in terms of entertainment. All things from storyline to music and from action scenes to quality of acting are brilliantly planned and executed. Even though the running time of the movie is almost 3.5 hours you actually don't feel its length.RK has really nailed it this time. This performance can be surely counted as one of his very best in terms of quality of acting. As much as I want to say the same thing for Rashmika, the element of common sense is simply not allowing me. Firstly, the quality of acting displayed by her is disappointing compared to her previous performances. And further I am still not able to understand why someone like her accepted the movie after reading the script.(may be due to RK). The character she plays feels like a clown in the movie.",positive
1,An Idiot Animal,"This movie has everything without any reason. The emotions are over the top and without any reason the actions are unnecessary. Prolonged storyline is foolish. There is no sense in anything in this movie. The movie contain disrespect to all the woman of the societies. Beat your mother, sister or wife. The movie defects and unnecessary and forceful son's love for his father. The family fued is unnecessary. Overall this is a garbage by an idiot Director such a waste of talented actors like Ranbir Kapoor and Anil KapoorDon't watch this movie even if it is free on Netflix. It's costly even if free.",negative
10,Beyond Blockbuster,"The way Father and Son Relation is showcased is Very Emotional, Many can Relate. It's an Tightslap to all so called Critics. Sandeep Reddy vanga jis direction and Ranbir's Acting skills makes movie raging fire . Movie is Reflection of an visionary director who showcases an Animal within us all . Why to Cry ? By title only it's very clear that Story is of an inhuman Animal & not some Pitty lover to cry over it's Toxicity , animal itself is Toxic in Nature when comes to his Animosity. Movie is rather not a Toxic , it just showcase Human nature & toxic is you who don't want to accept other side .",positive
10,A Movie That is Hard to Grasp by Some Indian Audience,"I see lot of negative reviews for animal, and I have to say these are probably the same people who clap on Salman Khan's stupid entries which are same in every movie. This movie marks as Ranbir's best ever performance and surpasses his previous bests Rockstar and Sanju. Animal is psychologically twisted movie that provides plenty of opportunities to its lead actor to shine, and Ranbir does exactly that. If you want to witness the best Bollywood has to offer in 2023, ignore these jokers and go watch it for yourself. Anima is a movie that justifies being 3.5 hour long and keeps you engaged the whole time, and no I did not feel I was bored even for a single minute.",positive
2,It's called a movie,"The film was very good but I felt that the girls were treated like a bully.Technically, there was no cohesive storyline. Dialogues were all over the place. Conversations between characters were weird. Like every time one would say something and other would go into an unrelated monologue. (Mostly ranbir).It's nothing like the trailer. Story is not about son and father. They didn't show anything about their relationship after the first few scenes.Coming to content, Ranvijay never knew to answer a question straight. His character had no consistency. Even if you make a negative character, his actions need to be consistent. In one instant they want to show he is unhinged and doesn't care, and then next instant he would forgive and protect them.A movie needs to have a story, a plot, characters need to make sense inside the movie.Their attempt at jokes were so distasteful. He gives a wedgie to a servant, rants about his underwear, there's two monologues about pubic hair, there's denial about medicine.Even the climax was so underwhelming. They just faught in one song.Worse part was how they used Sikhs in the movie. They tried to use them to do idk what. But they're just around to elevate Ranvijay. And in main climax they're told to stay back. Then killed on screen helplessly. Why would you show something like that.All in all, as a movie it sucks due to lack of story and badly written characters. Then there's the content.",negative
9,Great storyline,"The movie takes u on a roller coaster ride of emotions. It will make u feel angry, emotional and happy! No emotion is sustained for a long time, it switches back and forth and that is the beauty of the film. Ranbir has aced the role perfectly and he is the actual star of the film. Great background music makes it a banger. Rashmika is also well placed in the character and has done a tremendous work. She was trolled before the release but her acting was stupendous. She was the surprise package in the film. This is the best movie this year after KGF 2! There is something magical about south india directors, they effortlessly convey emotions without going overboard.",positive
9,Well Made Movie,"Direction : 10/10 for the Director, exceptionally directed, not a new story but the way it is made and presented is very well and interesting, and the screenplay choices made by the director is very good. The J cuts used makes us hooked to the film, even though the run time is very high, did not get bored.Music : Music department did an exceptional job, Songs are banger and the lyrics written are good. Special mention for the BGM, HARSHAVARDAN my man, you are a gem.Cinematography : once again great job, the cinematographer did not think like taking the center stage, camera is just viewing the actor from side and shown us the new angles.Violence and Fights : The fights are designed exceptionally well, enjoyed thoroughly, Violence did not made me feel uncomfortable, saw way more uncomfortable violent fights in Hollywood.Acting : Every Actor did an exceptional job.",positive
10,Blockbuster,"Blockbuster acting and excellent direction. It has everything that you need in a full Bollywood masala movie. This is not a character movie and so using intellectual brain while watching this movie would not be justice. Go with the mindset of entertainment and you will have full Paisa wasool experience. Superb acting, Excellent direction, Great dialogues, Wow music and Taabadtod action. Adding Punjab's pindu flavour is cherry on the cake. Not sure how the sequel will come out but Animal is surely worth watching. Actress should be changed in sequel. Boo y Deol has very short screen time but able to mark preaence.",positive
10,Perfect cinema,"First of all its a R-rated movie so there is no point of going with they use strong language nudity etc
And audience is giving all their love to movie
Its a perfect movie
The father son relation are well explored
""You do not like your father but by god you absolutely love him"" this is what this movie show us
Background score is freaking awesome
And yes Bobby is underutilized he got few screen time but he absolutely dominate the scenes he appears
And Ranbir is the superstar of this generation
And hats off to Sandeep vanga sir.This movie is not for everyone but if you watch this movie you won't regret it.",positive
10,Animal,"I saw the movie, uff omg. Tremendous awesome movie. I watched it and it feels like it's an awesome movie and everyone should watch this
Songs are lit and on next level
Action awesome, twist awesome and seriously I would love to watch it againI will go and watch again on Saturday. Please fo watch the movieRanbir kapoor Is next Irfan khan next Robert di Nero
I swear he gave me goosebumps and I was going nuts
I wish we had a chance to watch his acting live
It was so on point.Lord Bobby was amazing and the best part He spoke more than anyone else rather being quite
It was an inspiration to watch him grow.",positive
10,10/10 had 0 expectations but was blown away,"10/10 had 0 expectations but was blown away by the phenomenal acting by all, the story and the way the film was shot! From beginning to the end the story surprised me. I am looking forward to the sequel. I didn't rate Ranbir as an actor until I watched him in animal, he plays the character with so much conviction that I do believe it is really him. Although bit crazy felt the fundamentals of the story / relationships was relevant to today's society and I could relate.I also loved the music, it's being repeatedly played.I 100% recommend the movie. Please watch, ive not seen another hindi or hollywood movie like this ever!",positive
4,Unrealistic & Senseless,"I didn't see this in the theatre but just watched it on NF for the hype it created, and how overhyped it was.Now you know why some of these crap Bollywood movies make so much money.Unrealistic and senseless to say the least. Killing everyone at will, not a single law officer in sight. I personally don't think it was a full-on man-centric movie like many have suggested, but with so much male testosterone present, both female leads got more attention, and it showed on social media.The editing was poor.Gave it a 4-star as the potential of making a better movie was definitely on the cards, plot was good.RK's character was well played.Hopefully, the sequel can sort it out.",negative
6,Ranbir's Movie and Great Music and BM,"It's a Ranbir's movie. Nothing much in story, first half is good because of intense scenes of Ranbir. Second half has nothing much to offer as no good Ranbir's scenes.Bobby's 5-10 minutes cameo is great.Tripti is acting monster, needed little more time.Background score and music is another plus.Anil Kapoor is as usual good as father.Rashmika has decent amount of screen presence and does the job.Story lacks great villain most of the time until Bobby deol comes, but we see him for very less time
For an intense action oriented film we need villain.Overall one time watch, you can watch is for ranbir twice but I don't feel it has re-watch value.",negative
5,A rash that trashed the movie thereafter ....,"Though not conventional, Vanga's Arjun Reddy was enjoyable in bits and pieces;With Animal, he serves a lovely appetiser in the first half- followed by a main course which I unfortunately could neither chew nor enjoy. Following a recent walkout of Fukrey 3,I expected this would be a fun outing.Sadly it wasn'tViolence is enjoyable when it has a reason or a template - Tarantino's Kill bill series and Django unchained ;but ,it becomes unbearable once it assumes disgusting proportions with makers like Eli Roth .What upset me the most was the way they have made having a heart transplant look like ; like Indian cinema has ill treated its audience's intelligence over the years especially when it comes to medical scenarios and doctors, this movie is no different.The Kapoors are the only saving grace .Utterly disappointed and can empathise with RK for delivering such good performance in such a meaningless , mindless movie which could have panned out better with some thoughtful writing .Metaphorically and literally, All hell broke loose following a rash in RK's groin .",negative
10,Masterpiece By Sandeep Reddy Vanga!,"Brilliant Acting by Ranbir Kapoor And Anil Kapoor they both have done their roles brilliantly, only rashmika mandana acting was average throughout movie not bad but not that amazing also boby deol deserves special mention for his excellent acting in his special appearnace, the bgm was too amazing , whenever there was action scene it gave goosebumps in theatres the songs in the movie were also soulful and heart touching especially papa meri jaan by sonu sir and pehle bhi main by vishal mishra sir, all the aspects whether acting by lead actors, or bgm or story all the things were engaging thrilling and entertaining a must watch movie in theatres.",positive
10,Wonderful movie,"Animal takes audiences on an exhilarating journey through its visually stunning landscapes and thought-provoking narrative. The film seamlessly blends breathtaking cinematography with a compelling storyline, keeping viewers engaged from start to finish. The performances are commendable, with standout moments from the lead actors that add depth to the characters. The score complements the visuals beautifully, enhancing the overall cinematic experience. While some may find the pacing a bit slow, the film's exploration of profound themes and its memorable conclusion make it a worthwhile watch for those seeking a captivating and visually immersive cinematic escape.",positive
10,Insane,"Not writing much here. Go watch yourself. If you enjoyed Scarface, Pulp Fiction, Heat then this movie is cult. The fight scene between Bobby and Ranbir is poetic and high on emotions. Bobby has created the same impact which Anthony Hopkins created in ""Silence of the Lambs"" within a short screen time. Ranbir has rejuvenated himself and evolved as an actor. Anil is solid as always. Not to take anything away from the background score and music, syncs perfectly with the movie. The war cry ""Arjan Valley de"" and ""Sari duniya jala denge"" makes the action sequences at the next level. This is a movie which will be talked by generations to come. Full credits to Sandeep as well for not compromising on his vision and taking bold calls for this masterpiece.",positive
8,"A saga of masculinity, toxic relationships and trauma","Animal is a solidly divisive feature and quite rightly, you either love it or hate it, there are no middle paths here.Ranbir has now cemented his position as one of the finest actors in India, no doubt, although the entire cast is stellar. Anil Kapoor did not need to speak a word to showcase his pain and disgust but then, it's Anil Kapoor.With a good titular action set-piece, the film does not relent on brutality which is well placed given the race to be the apex predator in a world full of Animals. Ranbir's slow descent into madness is something that would be living room talk for a while.None of the critic reviews, many of them superficial and biased, capture why the movie is set in North India. It does justice to the patriarchal and masculine theme that runs throughout the movie like its lifeblood.The film has some inconsistencies too, some over the top dialogues during a weapons trade and an unnecessarily long love interest angle but these can be forgiven.The review would be incomplete without a mention of Bobby Deol, I hope he continues to get more opportunities else it's the audiences loss. I would have been fine with another 20 minutes of runtime just so Bobby could get more screen time.Finally, hats off to Sandeep Reddy for pulling this off. It reminded me of Todd Philip's Joker, politically incorrect, focused and in the face. Animal pulls off all stops in portraying its protagonist and his dilemmas and justifications.This is not a joy ride, not for the sensitive and the prejudiced. Watch it like a character study and the film would exceed expectations. An absolute must watch.",positive
1,Absolute disgrace,"Disgraceful plot! Disgraceful execution! Absolutely disgraceful concepts embedded in the film! Please do not allow such films to be even released in the OTT or any where please! The amount of chauvinistic comments and acts in the film are just disgusting!It was a mistake to watch this film! The self Proclaiming antagonist who is really so disgraceful in character and values. The stereotypes portrayed are far from reality, and no where close to what an actor who has the reach of Ranbir should be doing! The proclamation that he is a Superstar is something also invoking angry remarks! If at all someone from Bollywood can take that title, it can only be Amitabh Bachchan!",negative
10,Flawless performance and breathtaking cinematography,"From its opening scenes to the final credits, ""Animal"" captivated my attention through its compelling storyline, flawless acting, and breathtaking cinematography. In the realm of Indian cinema, this 2023 action thriller, skillfully directed and edited by the talented Sandeep Reddy Vanga, has emerged as a powerful force.Tripti, though limited to a small role, exudes charm. It's apparent that she may take the lead in the sequel; however, DJ Bobby's threats for a more extensive role were hindered by the film's runtime constraints. Notably, the supporting cast, including the esteemed Old, delivered commendable performances.Ranbir Kapoor, widely regarded as the most gifted actor in Indian cinema, serves as the heart and soul of the film. His portrayal evokes both disdain and fear, showcasing his remarkable acting prowess.",positive

1,Such a waste,"Directors, actors and producers should understand that movie is not a formula to mix a quarter of sex, a quarter of violence, a quarter of nudity and a quarter of angry young man. They don't make a movie. Get more into it. The entire movie was about Ranbir shouting, talking about anatomy and biology, kissing and having sex and justifying all his actions. He is here in the movie just to dominate everyone perhaps the actor though before signing the movie this would make him the greatest actors of all. There was no chemistry between the father and son even in hatred form. There are many movies that were made with father son not bonding and they were brilliant. Anil Kapoor had just one expression in the entire movie. Nothing about him suited as the world's richest man. Rashmika had huge MTI delivering the dialogues. Her character was something I guess just made to shown how women should be kept as per the director. Such a waste of time. Not even a single moment came when I got excited to see what's next in the movie. It fails as an entertainer, as a movie as anything. Kabir Singh was yet a far better story although I don't support characters like him. I don't know how are they even celebrating this movie and why should these type of stories need to be told. It's a waste of time and energy. There is no takeaway from the movie even in terms of entertainment. Just a self proclaimed superstar.",negative
1,Worst movie ever,"Not sure why i spent my time and money on this movie. Where are all the feminists now? Looks like all their wisdom didnt get the tickets for this movie. Or might be the starcast present in this movie whitewashes whatever the drunk writer was doing while writing this movie. As once a great sage from gangs of wasseypur said ""Jab tak saneema hai log chutiya bante rahenge!""
The only good part about this movie was bobby deol and i think that was because his years of efforts and thankfully writer didnt gave him any dialogue. Else the writer would have ruined him too.All this movie is about is rich with their own self created problems and them thinking the rest of the world is theirs rich fathers gift to them as a play thing.",negative

-- What a brother he is
-- And a hell for his enemiesSome scenes may look violent but we have seen worst. Some scenes may look unreaslistic but we have seen Hatimtai and Himmatwalas as well.I am in awe with this movie - RK, BD ..laods of love...Be it the romantic side or the violent or the emotional, Director and Actors have done great justice with roles.

The actors did a n amazing job portraying these characters.I didn't liked the ending of Anil kapoor's character that much since the movie was entirely based on fathers love and all.But the Animal park scene was a lit and it shows how amazing of a actor ranbir kapoor really is in both Heroic and Villan role.This is just my opinion of the movie since reviews are based on personal experience of a person watching the movie.",positive

10,A true Bhartiya Movie.,"This movie is so special. Everyone played their role with a zeal. I searched the name of director after watching it and I went to watch it again. Sandeep Reddy Venga the Director of this movie is really having a Bhartiya heart, He is a true Bhartiya Soul, ""Puri tarah se Atmanirbhar Bharat"" audience applouded on this dialogue. Everyone song and background music... everything what is shown and what is indicated in this movie is having a deep meaning. Father Son Emotional drama, Every one in this country having almost same Emotion for their family. Fight scenes, songs, dialogue, silence evrything is of next level, the true level. A true Indian Soul movie. May be some couldn't have understood the movies deep concept, I recommend everyone to go and enjoy the movie.",positive
4,Unintentionally Comical,"I think the biggest issues with the movie are a lack of a general direction and taking itself too seriously. If they had gone for a dark comedy, the movie could have been much better. The very intentional misogyny, abrupt addition of new people throughout the movie without any character development just seems too comical. Going back to the lack of direction, the movie started off as a son's dysfunctional relationship with his father, but somehow the director forgot about it halfway.The acting and the background music are good, some scenes are shot well, but nothing we've not seen before in movies like Oldboy, Kill Bill etc. There were many unnecessary plotlines, making the movie way too long.Also, I have a very sneaky suspicion that Mr. Director added the misogynistic dialogues just to mess with the critics. I mean those scenes are just funny right?",negative
10,You will like it or hate it. Nothing in middle,"Let me be clear that I loved the movie. Everyone did an amazing acting.I loved the way Sandeep sketched the characters and story plot.

10,Embodying the epitome of strength and resilience.,"An electrifying cinematic masterpiece, this Bollywood gem brilliantly weaves a narrative around a compelling alpha male, the scion of the country's wealthiest tycoon. Unraveling a tale of relentless determination to safeguard his family, the film captivates with intense violence and an unwavering bond that resonates. Drawing parallels with Hollywood's iconic 'The Godfather,' it not only matches but transcends expectations, carving its niche as a formidable contender in the realm of powerful storytelling and alpha male protagonists.A triumph in its own right, this Bollywood gem stands proudly alongside its global counterparts, leaving an indelible mark on the cinematic landscape.""",positive
10,the best movie in bollywood not one of the. It is the best action,You can see the other reviews of guys they are totally fans of shahrukh and salman thats why ranbir did better than these khans ... most of the reviews were from our peaceful community ... chatukars of srk and sk... movie was a masterpiece one of a kind in Bollywood ... these are those guys who enjoyed keanu reeves in john wick. If you get my point what i want to say then you get. There is a community who doesn't get other stars because of their bias nature. This movie is such a master piece and you will love it i am sure if you love hollywood then you will surely love it . You will cherish this movie after watching.,positive
10,Best Movie Of This Decade- Let Feminist Cry,"It is one of the best movie, I have ever seen, I can watch this movie 100 times in theatres. The bonding between father and son is amazing. Thank you vanga sir for such a masterpiece. The way Ranbir carried out his personality is amazing.Storyline is fantastic, music is top notch. Bgm makes you attached with this movie, It doesn't fell like you are watching a 3.5 hour long movie. Action scenes and acting quality is brilliant.This is an unique entertainment package which everyone will love. After a long time there's been something in Bollywood which is so good and enjoyable that we can watch this again and again.Bobby deol also nailed with his performance, although his screen presence is very short.Bollywood need more such entertainment package! Thank you vanga sir for such masterpiece 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻",positive
8,A Tale of Father & Son every guy could relate to....,"Refreshing & Unique. The acting, set design, scale, music, and cinematography are comparable to something from Hollywood. It shows the reality of a flawed father-son relationship that is deeply rooted in Indian society. How far will a child go for his father's love? The point of the film is not about righteousness or the realism of the characters, but rather why the main character became what he is. Watch it with an open mind, and you'll realize there's nothing like this ever made by Bollywood. Hats off to Sandeep Reddy Vanga for his direction and for being bold enough to make something like this, and for the excellent performances by Ranbir, Anil, Rashmika, and Bobby. Overall, it was an experience, and you can learn a lot from the main character despite his flaws, as not everything is black or white; there is always a grey area. I don't think this movie glorified anything; it's just the way the character is. Everyone has enough brains to differentiate between the rights and wrongs of the character. It's up to you in the end what you'll take away from the movie. That's how cinema should be: Raw and Unfiltered.",positive
10,Worthy watch,"""Animal"" is a cinematic masterpiece that left an indelible mark on my viewing experience. The film's narrative brilliance is complemented by exceptional performances, particularly from the lead actors who seamlessly bring their characters to life. The script is a rollercoaster of emotions, skillfully blending suspense, drama, and moments of unexpected humor.The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing both the raw beauty of nature and the intensity of the characters' emotions. The use of lighting and camera angles enhances the storytelling, creating a visually stunning tapestry that keeps the audience engaged from start to finish.The soundtrack is a standout element, perfectly synchronized with the unfolding plot and adding an extra layer of depth to the viewing experience. Each musical piece resonates with the mood of the scenes, enhancing the emotional impact and leaving a lasting impression.One of the film's strengths lies in its ability to tackle profound themes with nuance and sensitivity. It delves into complex human emotions, relationships, and the intricacies of the animal kingdom, weaving them together seamlessly. The symbolism and metaphors employed add layers of meaning, encouraging contemplation long after the credits roll.The pacing is impeccable, with each scene contributing to the overall narrative without unnecessary detours. The film keeps viewers on the edge of their seats, skillfully building tension and suspense until the climactic resolution that delivers a satisfying and thought-provoking conclusion.""Animal"" is a thoughtfully crafted cinematic gem that transcends traditional genre boundaries. It invites viewers to reflect on their own humanity, the interconnectedness of all living beings, and the delicate balance between civilization and the wild. This film is a testament to the power of storytelling and visual artistry, leaving a profound impact that lingers in the mind well beyond the closing credits.",positive
2,Downhill all the way...,"I'm giving it 2 but not 1 because of the consistency. This thoughtless lengthy movie somehow managed to consistently go downhill right from the start. I watched it to see what the hype was about, and I couldn't figure this out.This abomination of a movie comprises the following 7 sins:1. Lack of a plot with any depth
2. No significant character to root for
3. Extremely disrespectful to females
4. No respect for physics or biology
5. Unnecessary infidelity
6. Cartoonish action sequences which will remind you of 80s linear fighting games where NPCs keep on spawning from God knows where

1,Terrible Movie!,"If you want to torture yourself for 3.5 hours, this is your movie.Toxic masculinity and misogyny at its best. It's not even worth one watch.Do yourself a favor and watch something else. Can't believe such movies still get made in this time and year and people spend money to watch this in cinema. I'm not sure what all the hype is about, probably the marketing team has done their job right.If I could, I would give this movie a negative rating. No logic, psychopathic behavior and absolutely no message is given out to the society. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. An absolute garbage of a movie praising toxicity, misogyny and narcissism.",negative
9,Must watch movie,Must watch movie for understanding the reality of male ego. Even in today's generation no one's dad will excepts his mistake in front of his children(son) because he knew that when he will except the mistake then in his childrens mind he will be going to be a wrong person. This reality of male ego has been described by Anil Kapoor. And what happens after that as a dad and sons relationship has been clearly expressed by Ranbir. Yes their are lots of things in the middle of the story in which Rashmika has faced because Ranbir as her husband in which she tries to pull him out of his animal character. She has to face lots of nonsense things because of him which was against thier relationship which should not be their in the movie. He acts very dishonestly with her which is why I didn't like that specific thing. Apart from this the movie was really very good.,positive
10,"Don't see or listen to critic's review, go for animal - Must watch movie","This movie taught how to raise his or her kids and the most beautiful shot of this movie is how protagonist protected a family tho he got much humiliation from his family. A director has a mass cinematic vision to show audience a real cinema without filter. A antagonist portrayed his role as a revengeful emotional man who has no sympathy for his opponents. Audience would get a real taste of a movie in a vangaism story. This a real cinema and everyone must accept a bitter truth. I accept a movie is abit lengthy, could have decreased a runtime but it is worthy to see a ranbir kappor act in each scene.Go for animal.",positive
10,Best Movie Ever,"One word discription Amazing . Best movie of Ranbir Kapoor's career . All the casting crew are amazing .

9,Entertaining!!! So do not expect the family caters.,"In Totality the movie is super entertaining even in some point of time it gives the emotional feelings in the family realtion's touch. Directors wanted to show the friendly atmosphere and care taking method, between family memebers. I.e. Brother-sister, brother-brother, fater-son and other family bonding. Overall the movie is entertaining. Ranbir Kapoor is just a perfect and wow persality and good human bening, he is too good to act in this movie and i think the roll what he got in this movie suited to him perfectly. Bobby Deol has also Re-opend his acting career with this movie. Everybody love to learn with all the actors.",positive
8,Solid answer by Sandeep to Critics,As soon as film starts Rabir characterization hits us very hard with badass mass stuff.Ranbir shines off well in sandeep matured characterization and delivers an outstanding performance. An overall path breaking first half with too much violence followed by engaging drama.When it comes to second half the movie gets slightly boring with its melo dramatic proggression. Unfortunately none of the villans have proper depth and screen space to perform even though bobby deol shines well.Entire climax portion is too good and engaging.The length of the movie doesn't matter at all you will be engaged and entertained till the last shot.,positive
10,This movie is not for faint hearted,"If you are fan of Hollywood movies like Kill Bill and Sin City then Animal for you. Otherwise do not waste your time and money. Brilliantly made Bollywood movie. Ranbir, Anil Kapur and Bobby Deol excellent acting. Rashima stil needs to steps specially with her Hindi accent. Star cast and storyline is superb. This movie may be ahead of the time that is why so many people are giving negative reviews. Just go the movie without any baggage and enjoy the ride only in theaters. Loved this movies so much. Wanted still more. May be can watch it again until Animal Park comes. If movies on feminism are accepted in society with open heartedly then why not Animal?",positive
10,DON'T LISTEN TO ONLINE CRITICS!!,"I have watched this movie 3 times in theaters, because of its such good dialogues, brilliant acting, awesome songs, and Sandeep Reddy Vanga's movie direction.I bet you have never seen a movie like this.This is a perfect movie to watch with your friends. This is what bollywood so needed to revive its lost glory.But aside all this, I will say this, that maybe this movie is probably not for everyone. This movie is not for those who are staunch feminists. People need to open their mind a bit, to enjoy this movie... Not every movie should agree with your beliefs.If you keep you mind open while watching this and not nitpick everytjing then, I am sure you will enjoy this.Ciao.",positive
10,This movie is amazing i watched at middle night at 2 am to 5 am,"In this movie a son undergoes a remarkable transformation as the bond with his father begins to fracture, and he becomes consumed by a quest for vengeance and this movie ranbir kapoor as vijay act is showing how much he love his father in this movie anil kapoor act as balbir singh and the balbir singh is the father of vijay and they having a Delhi-based business magnate who heads the generational steel company ""Swastik Steels"". .this movie also teach us a lesson how many responsbilities in family to protect them from this world on son's and grow a family business and never involve a third person in your family bussiness and never give your child place to anyone.",positive
7,Watch it for what it is.,"It is NOT a movie for people seeking meaningful cinema. It is not a movie which has a strong, cohesive storyline. And it certainly doesn't have a protagonist who anyone should seek to be. But the movie is self-aware of the Animal that it has created, and that's it. Watch this movie for what it is - an adrenaline fueled 3.5 hour journey with some pretty good fights, great back-ground music and loud (both literally and methaphorically) characters who do oppulent and out-of -the-world stuff one would never dream of doing. Watch it like you would, a pornography - to see your wildest what-ifs played out on the big screen. There is something about this movie that leaves you shook and uncomfortable, but I liked it nevertheless. And to all those who think this is too gruesome and overtly sexualised, I hope you didn't feel any different about all the AltBalaji crap that keep you glued to your screens :)",positive
9,It's like a Marmite! You'll either Love it or Hate it!,"This movie is like a Marmite! You will either Love it or Hate it, there's no middle ground. If you appreciate art in its true form with no judgements then probably you should watch it! While the storyline is a cliche with the age old father and son sentiment, the movie is still worth watching for the efforts Ranbir, Anil and Bobby has fuelled in.In terms of the storyline yes, it's a bit lengthy and could have been easily wrapped up well within 2.5 to 3hrs. However, Sandeep reddy has chosen to make it more intense by adding the extra minutes on the clock but the story just melts in. If you have loved it through the half way then you wouldn't mind the 3+ hrs of screen time. The story just unfolds itself and makes you think it makes sense.The movie is high octane with action scenes blended with family emotions. While the love story seems quite Alpha as Ranbir describes in the movie it's got its own charm.If you are a father, then I wouldn't be surprised if you shed a tear or two. The message is quite strong at the end which you will take home.Rashmika has tried quite hard to fit into Bollywood but her charms fail to impress the audience. There are a number of B-town heroines who fit into this role much appropriately.You will love Bobby's 10 min screen time and his entry and energy through the end.With all due respect, if you are a feminist then you're better off avoiding the movie.The movie is ahead of its time for Indian audiences and too raw for some classes of the society.",positive
6,Superb minus unnecessary drama,"First half of the movie - 10/10.Second half - 5/10.The second half was just a filler and contributed nothing to the storyline. Take the first half and stitch it with the last 20 minutes and you have a blockbuster.There are some scenes that are too exagerated, especially the Ranbir vs mob scene that's shown in the trailer too. How can a person kill 200 people if he hasn't been trained with different elements of fighting or warfare?The college going Ranbir looks awesome. The movie captures the thinking and emotions of the youngsters of that era extremely well.Just keep the logic aside and go watch the movie. It's worth watching even with it's illogical second half. Overall, you won't get disappointed.Ranbir may get the best actor award for this one.",negative
10,"Awesome acting, amazing BGM. Cry all you want who is intentionally spreading negetive review, it ain't gonna effect the result.","Although it is a long film, you will never feel that except in one instance i.e., Tripti Dimri's block. Ranbir has lit the screen with his acting, Rashmika's character starts dull but it does improve during the progression of the movie and the BGM is just wow.Songs were not typical Indian songs where lead cast travel to another location and dance. During the song the story progresses so it means the entire 203minutes is just story and a Paisa vasool film.Many critics and people are intentionally spreading negative reviews which is sad to see. But it ain't gonna effect the result of the movie because people already owned it.It is so stupid to say that people learn from movies we humans are intelligent beings we know what to take from a film and what not.",positive
10,Looks like Bollywood has gone bankrupt of stories!,"Stupid movie..full of violence and illogical story. Bollywood will never again rule India anytime soon. Media is been sold, that's why they praise so much about this C grade movie. Rashmika's character is been treated very badly and in poor light..Promoting gun culture in school was one more disastrous scene in the movie.I think after KGF only this ""hero single handedly fighting and killing 100-200 villains"" and ""using monster kind of machine guns"" became a trend, but KGF managed to show fights and killings in a decent way unlike Animal where in Ranbir slits Bobby's throat in ISIS style. Long story cut short, Waste of time and money to watch this pathetic bloody movie!",positive
10,Amazing,"This film blew me away! Yes it has blood, gore and fighting and etc and the film never got boring with it being 3hrs! It's not a film for everyone and definitely not a film to watch with parents if they don't like all of the above (blood gore and s*x reference!) - yes it has some triggers of abuse which is not easy to watch but it's well thought out and at the end of the day it's a story that should be told! It's rated 18 for a reason. Watch this for what it is and don't listen to people who don't like violence and gore - watch it and make your own assumption of the film! Good acting from all actors/actresses and it was great to see Shakti Kapoor back on the big screen!",positive
10,awesome movie,"Animal"" a movie from which i expected a lot (as people were saying its going to change indian cinema) It is a nice movie you can go to thetere grab some popcorns enjoy the first half with brilliant BGM, Action And ranbir kapoor's amazing acting skills that Adranline rush just amazing the story was also going nice. As the second half starts the action starts fading away and people starts having full conversion that you barely see in first half Some of the dilogues in the movie are very nicely written medical terms used very aptly that dilogue about swastik and Nazi symbol (detailing)Amazing!!Ranbir(Vijay):He is a phenomenal actor he really make you fall in love with him when he is on screen though some things which he does seems unrealisticRashmika (Geetanjali): she did a nice job being a ""wife"" her character was very important for film and according to me she played it convincinglyAnil kapoor (Balbir singh):He was well casted for this role. He portrayed the feeling of helplessness when somebody over loves u & their love starts becoming toxic to everybody around but You can't really do anything about it very nicely.Boby Deol( Abrab) :u barely see him on screen but when he is on then you'll not see anyone not even ranbir his body his aura everything was impeccable.Story: when we go to watch a hyped movie as an audience we expect to watch something new or Extraordinary but it was nothing like that. I felt director just mixed old bollywood and Tollywood with a touch of modern BGM Action and nice cinematography thats it Overall a nice engaging story with some twists.Director: Sandeep Reddy Vanga said ""I'll show what Violent film is!!"" And he did👍🏻
Movie is Misoginystic!! But i do believe that writers should have liberty to write anything Vanga seems like when he writes he just writes what's going on his head he take all outI Hope indian youth and audience will see it as entertainment only nothing beyond that!!it's a story where you'll experience Gutsy love between Son & Father, Husband &wife, Brother & Sister, in a raw manner.",positive
2,Disappointing,Such a disappointment this movie is. Have given 2 star for acting of ranbir & anil kapoor & specially bobby deol. I always liked Bobby deol's acting and he nailed it too good. But full of Unrealistic events everywhere in the movie and unnecessarily made that movie very long. I didn't have that much expectation but the acting which was good. But rockstar movie acting of ranbir was far far better than this. Rashmika was good but couldn't understand most of her dialogue. Animal in such a way only shown the cruelty but not the intelligence and sharpness. It was like some kid does the direction and editing. Overall very bad experience.,negative
8,Super Duper Entertainment,"I just loved it and although a one-time see it does have few repeat values. It's not one of those meaningful films which invokes your emotions subtly. However, I cannot refute that this movie has a clear-cut father-son relationship sketched in minimal time and without much effort. The director did a brilliant job on this unlike many other films which go on for endless hours just to bring out father-son relation forcefully. If you are truly spiritual, believe in self, attained self-realization and are confident to make out life journey without help than this movie will inspire you as it did for me.",positive
1,A porn movie in the name of cinema,"This movie is no different than a porn movie. Ranbir's character always thinks of lust and has extramarital affairs. The movie is made to lure the young generation in the name of violence. It is 80% sex and 20% violence.Just showing love for parents doesn't make this movie good. This movie is just sex-sex-sex. Almost all the movies these days revolve around the theme of sex. The directors do not know the power of celibacy.Bollywood is paid just to show sex, sex, and sex. Our young generation needs to boycott these types of nude films. These films run at the box office successfully only because they have polluted our minds with dirty, nude films. Where will our younger generation be if they continue to watch these types of movies?",negative
10,Father and son love Bound and Angry Man,"Hello, I am Rahul saksena my thoughts and perspective about this movie Animal is Very Good and meaningful sense. Because love, fight, Anger,lust,bad habits like smoking, drinking, This is a example of a Agressive and bold powerful Men. But 2nd side men control every emotion in a balance Manner Because we are fight for family love and a joyful life but some people doesn't want to see your joyful life so every men cross our limit of patience. Because of i want to be a future cinematographer in film and web series. I give best rating for shooting in Very good day light and night artificial lightings. I appreciate to cinematographer of this movie.",positive
9,Class,"Every movie has a good story, so does this. They have good songs, great action and an engaging suspense. This has all of that and some plots where you may be left wondering. Punjab's portrayal finally isn't offensive to the rest of the country. There are also flaws but the level of acting is legendary. Ranbir Kapoor separates himself from the league of Ranveer, Shahid and similar middling actors. He also opens doors for possibly more South Indian movies. Bobby Deol is unbelievable and says so much without actually not saying anything, his is easily fit for a Hollywood action/western psychotic villian. This movie has Class.",positive
8,WILD!!!,"Sandeep's wild Animal is all about animals in the world of humans. It is packed with intense action scenes, untamed emotions, and extreme love, making it a thrilling choice for action enthusiasts. However, it may not appeal as much to sensitive viewers, so they might want to steer clear. Sandeep has penned an unconventional screenplay for a familiar storyline. We have already witnessed his unique perspective with arjunReddy, and this film is no exception. The movie is adorned with fantastic dialogues that will send shivers down your spine, and you have to admire his profound thoughts and insights. The first half is flawlessly executed, leaving no room for boredom, but the second half could benefit from some trimming as not everything needs to be conveyed through dialogues. The one-on-one conversations do offer valuable messages but can be lengthy at times. This film takes a lot of artistic liberties, and while it may not appear realistic, believe me when I say that Sandeep is one of the most unconventional filmmakers this industry has ever seen. His dialogues are like bullets and he brings out stellar performances. He is a trailblazer in this industry, revolutionizing contemporary filmmaking. Kudos!",positive

5,It's a one man show!,"In simple words it could not meet the expectations that had been created. The story is very simple. No twists and turns. Vijay is an angry young man who seeks validation of his father in his whole life. However, for that not much thought was given on character development. Also I felt that it dragged action scenes unnessarily at some scene. I went to the theater hoping to see some dark psychology and twisted characters! Something that we get to see in Malaylam or telegu films. Pure violence with an amazing story line and characters. But here same bu****it again! I gave 5 star because of Rabir Kapoor's acting skills. He did his best to perform the role.",negative
2,Not for You!,"If you coming here to read hows movie Animal ?? Then I assume you are the person with good choices in the film. If you like typical South movies with complicated twist, exaggerated action scenes and glorified hot scenes then this movie is for you.

Please don't watch it with your family you will be ashamed of things they are showing and saying in movies. If you still planning to watch this movie theen please atleast carry ear plugs because soon the unbearable loud background music make you 🤢",negative
1,The downfall of Indian Cinema,What a waste of money and talent. It is rightly said that when director's do not have a story they use sex and violence to sell their work. The whole story is just sick. Do not know why bobby deol was so hyped that he cried in one event for the role. He must cry for his role which is just pathetic. Ranbeer is a good actor but after watching his bhramastra and now this I have developed a hatered for the actor. That south inidan girl acting and dilouge is just pathetic. The actress infact all the women is potryed weak and gold digger in the movie. That foriegner role was just for sex and money. What a waste of time.,negative

8,Loved every min!,I must say this movie definitely had me glued to the screen. Not a massive fan of ranbir but have to admire all the different looks he pulled off. Action scenes were class and definitely enjoyed the gruesome parts of the movie. Nice for bollywood to have a change. Maybe would have been nice to stay away from the nudity but doesn't downgrade the movie. People need to remember it is all done by a SCRIPT! So many people taking the movie to heart talking about promoting shooting in a school and the whole alpha male vibe that is brought to the movie. IT IS PURELY FICTIONAL. Surprised we haven't heard any complaints about om shanti om encouraging people to die to enforce reincarnation 🤣🤣,positive
1,No ethics! Is this where Bollywood is going towards?,"Filmmakers of Bollywood should exercise a greater sense of responsibility and awareness before creating movies that depict excessive cruelty, misconduct towards women, mocking relationships in general.I don't write reviews too often, but this one left me no choice. I felt ashamed watching this movie, knowing I was a fan of Bollywood in old days. This movie should have been banned or at least severely moderated.Our youth watching these movies inherits so much negativity by watching. Please stop making movies just to earn more money and actually make something which inspires people positively instead.",negative
1,Worst movie,"Very cheap mentality characters, no strong story line.. just the publicity and one song created hype. Nothing in the movie. At least 2 to 3 thousand people must have died as per the movie script.. they all don't have family, father son bonding.. all of they are just born to die in the hands of psychopath hero who things he is a alfa male by mistake.. I don't know how people watched this movie in theater with their wife or sisters or mother, I just can't watch this garbage in OTT itself.

I don't know if a underage or a teen.. how he or she will be manipulated.",negative
6,Don't watch,"Full of unnecessary violence. Exploits woman, it so so masculine and so undermining character. I understand, papas nonsense made him animal, so what?

If you need stories, go to malayalam then. How come a man kills thousands alone, gets fit told fight after cardiac surgery!Ranbir acted well, but I still say he deserves better stories. Rashmika and Dell is total waste, no real importance on the screen. Rashmika always playing an oppressed-dumb woman in every single film, this one Isn't an exception. Anil is so so.I think after watching so many masculine bolly movies from different actors, next year people will stop going to theatre again! Stop promoting negativities as heroism.",negative
5,Deviating the Society to Violence..,I totally agree there is a message to a father who is been loved by a son.. However the movie has lots of violence and adult scenes which seems to be a bad impact on the viewers.... My message to the director is please reduce the exposure and violence a movie should always be an entertainment and a message oriented. I am sure if you consider the above suggestion .. You will certainly come up with a movie which would be loved by many viewers.. The younger generation has to learn the reality of life let's not make them more cynical.please think about this on a serious note a friendly advise to the director.,negative

They abused me all the way to home after this. What bobby deol saw in this script and why he agreed is questionable.

9,Venga vision and park of violence,"The brutality was always censored in Indian soil exploring hardcode pessimistic themes or exploring the exsisting themes with a pessimistic and brutal lens and critical reflections of ambiguity is something what venga signature of direction is
Misogynism is about Kabir Singh but celebrating the toxic and featuring the red lines and red flags is always a stubborn challenge but venga had performed it swiftly as an sweeping wind in the monsoon
Animal the Ranbir Kapoor never seen avatar which projects it's versatility and confidence within himself to perform the character it's psychological intense and the most important the obsession of being a Wolf at the centre is something which describes the layer of intensification and potentially the Ranbir caries which is stupendous
** Crossing the line and making the new genere in Indian cinema
This section is one i want to explore and talk about the cultural determined preset cinematic norns have been transcended by portraying the boldness and gore and every element which an A filim must deliver heads up to venga for creating an epitome and euphoric DIMENSION of an adult oriented filim exploring bold nudity violence just left out was rape pedophilia and incest and an element of canabalisim human vamparisim etc which I belive will transcend the borders in upcoming movies

An family oriented at the centre but not in a postive but in an never seen pessimistic dark critical reflections and obsession avoid with family but look out for the family is what the motive is. Behind vengas vision.",positive

1,Disaster and Disappointment,"The conclusion to this movie would be- The story line was probably written by multiple writers. All of them were unaware of what the other person was writing. This would explain the illogical storyline, character arc and inconsistencies in the movie!There was no character building, no sub plot, no reason or context whatsoever to understand what was actually happening and, why was it happening? It is a mindless action flick where even the violence is unjustified. Out of nowhere a violent scene would pop up and it doesn't even suits the storyline. The editing was below par. The direction was the worst of all. I do not think that he understands how movie making works.There was no character development. We get to know that the title character is mentally unstable as he did not get enough attention from his father in his childhood. There were no instances of relevance where this could have been substantiated. The lead (Ranbir's character) doesn't have any morality or principle. It is possible as the character might have been written as such. Although, the director tries to portray the lead as a person with intellect and morality at first. Then I guess he forgets everything for the next 20 minutes straight. The comedy scenes were utterly pathetic and the amount of useless dialogs around sex was horrible. They could have deleted at least 45 minutes and maybe it would have been okay. Who am I kidding, it was really bad and nothing would have made it okay.I can go on and on about how much of a horrible movie 'Animal' is, but I suppose Indian filmakers are not evolved enough to make a proper movie on such subjects. They can't handle such complex a characters and emotions. Box office collections of this mindless movie is really high and that is a sad thing to see.Please avoid it for your own sanity.",negative

6,Bold and Brutal,"The movie is bold and quite brutal. The background music gives it a unique vibe. Ranbir Kapoor and Anil Kapoor's acting will not let you take your eyes off the screen. Sunny, despite having a smaller role, played fabulously. Along with that, the Punjabi characters won hearts with their amazing acting and action scenes. Despite the positives, there are some negatives. The first half of the movie is better than the second half. The second half feels a bit slow. The extent to which someone can go for their father is worth watching, but at times, it seems unrealistic like how can this be done. Zoya's scenes could have been better. Sunny sir should have had more screen time because he looked great. Other than that, openly discussing sexual matters in the movie feels strange. The ending could have been better in some ways, but it was good. I'm giving it 6 stars; I expected a more sensible storyline. Overall, it's a one-time watch.",negative
10,Movie of the decade,"I have never ever experienced anything like this in a theatre, it's a must watch movie. Ranbir is 11/10, incredibly perfect in every scene. Can such a long movie three and half hours retain your interest, normally no but in this one it did retain. Bobby Deol is also fantastic although the role is short but impactful. A big big Big round of applause for the director for shooting and showing the scenes so perfectly... totally starstrucked... Ranbir will be the inspiration to many actors in the generations to come. I cherish cinema only when the work quality is healthy hence I must say that such actors like Ranbir are maintaining the standards.",positive
5,"Wonderful acting, Great Action & Shitty Morale","The movie excels at characters, acting, action, some real father son chemistry and deep emotions.The lead character however is violent, immature, alpha male and promotes toxic masculinity and demotes women. The story glorifies such character and hence I have given a low score. I don't promote, accept, or like cinema which brings negative changes in viewers and on society.I seriously don't know how a actor who can act so well, accepts such movie scripts. I mean they should give Ranbeer a best actor award for this movie but Still i believe auch movies shouldn't be aired.Cinema should always bring positive changes in society and this movie does exactly opposite. Save your time and dime, avoid this.",negative
10,A courageous attempt... hats off Sandeep sir.,"We do not see movies so bold and courageous as Animal. We indians are accustomed to watch romantic, emotional and boring bollywood movies but someone presents a movie as 'Animal' in front of us, its hard for us to digest and hence it creates two polar groups, lovers and haters.The movie has bold action and violence admist of a father son bond. It touches the true emotion of a boy, what he goes through in the childhood when he idolizes someone who do not respect or reciprocates his feelings. As a result a Animal is born.There are few scenes which our feminist and misogynist comunity does not like but their opinion. The same protagnist also accepts slaps from his wife and does not return it back and puts shoes on her feet with his hands when she is about to walk on ice.Its a powerful action packed film with hidden meanings. Must watch.",positive
10,Ranbir's acting was wow,"Don't bother reading the negative reviews. I'd say it's not a movie for all.Quite simply put: if you don't mind the gore and violence like in the John Wick series then you will enjoy this movie. If you didn't like that then don't bother wasting your time and money watching this movie as you wouldn't enjoy it.The sexual scenes were unnecessary. However, overall the movie was intense and thrilling from the get go. The acting was amazing from Ranbir, Anil and Bobby. I do agree more of Bobby Deol scenes would've been nicer.I really enjoyed this movie. The ending was just wow.. like can't wait for the next one to be honest. Wonder what more craze they're going to bring about in the next one.",positive
2,3.5 hrs of unnecessary gore and violence!,"I am not sure what the story line of this movie is- all you can see is gore and violence!One man who is out to kill everyone who is not in line with him, his beliefs, views and way of life!Anil Kapoor was good.I don't think the movie needed any other cast- they could just have Ranbir Kapoor out in the street killing random people from start to end- that's this movie!There is some story line but that kinda gets all muddled with the violence.I think a better name for the movie would have been Dracula instead of Animal- someone out for blood.Glad animals don't watch movies and did not have to go through 3 plus hours of pain LOL.",negative
10,BRILLIANT MOVIE FOR CINEPHILES 👍,"Masterpiece movie 🔥🔥. This is of movies made once in a eternity. Lots of drama, violence, brilliant set design. I am loosing my words to portray this movie. I wish his type of movies should be made in future.All the negative comments for this movie are from senseless people, they don't know how a movie is made. If Mr. Vanga throwed some money on these so-called movie critics then they would've gave 9-10 stars.All the cast did wonderful job. RANBIR KAPOOR gave the legendary performance.Mr. Vanga is genius, he knows everything. From casting to BGM, script writing, everything. This man is born to define movies.Watch this movie only in theatre otherwise you will miss out this LEGENDARY MOVIE.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥",positive
2,"Waste of time, should have worked a little on storyline as well.","Waste of time, should have worked a little on storyline as well.Since beginning movie was centered on just one single thing, Son's love towards father.Too much useless fights and vulgarity added to get audience attention, which was not needed at all.Ranveer Kapoor call few untrained youngsters from village and they were fighting like pro-shooter.He was killing so many people in different countries and returned back home and no police case against him.After lilling Bobby Deol he returned back India soaked with blood and blood was fresh. Wondering he didn't even needed Visa or emigration to travel between countries.Ranveer Kapoor got Heart replacement surgery and just after that he was fighting like he never had any health issues or surgery.If you don't want to use your brain amd just want to watch for time pass, can watch, else don't waste yourntime.",negative
9,"Intense,somewhat dark,power packed!!!!!","I went with alot of expectations..and it it did fulfill more than what i expected. Ranbir has proven it many a times how good an actor he is...it was just a matter of a good story connecting the dots with his brilliant performance..i know at times this film has some flaws ,but still i may watch it more than once...background score, intense plot with camera on ranbir eyes is making the scenes comelling to watch and praise..
Bobby deol,Anil kapoor ,rashmika and other actors were also good..Bobby acted well but had a smaller yet an important role..wished more screen time for him..But at the end it was ranbir show..
Though punjabi is pretty much understandable but being a hindi movie for people from hardcore hindi region-at few places it could be replaced with hindi..
Would recommend to everyone (except who doesnt like bloody action)",positive
10,I like,"Man. Ranbeer kapoor, and his pind brothers, what a lit and elite squad. Absolutely run havon in the city.Vanga simply says it bluntly on everyones face, i will dare to do what i want and show what i want and he has done that.Vangas vision is completely fulfilled by ranbeer and all other actors. Movie becomes little boring in 2nd half. But the finale is good. It is about the real man to man fight.Am still in awe of ranbeers role. This is his best acting till date. Kudos to all. Rashmika did grt in her part as well as anil kapoor. Bobby has also done good. This is a must watch theater ..,..",positive
2,Excellent movie to vet out zombies,"It takes some effort to create a movie that appeals to those who cannot be reasoned with, so kudos to the producer and director for that. Also a round of slow applause to those who paid to watch this.I was an innocent victim of Netflix, who drew amusement from other's expressions and threshold of torture. Eventually everyone fell by the wayside before the last half an hour, which implies nearly 3 hours of one's life lost to something that deserves less attention than a paperweight.One can imagine a movie trying to convey a story, message or a form of entertainment. This one is beyond that kind of imagination. In fact, one needs to be deprived of it.It probably speaks of the state of Bollywood where it is stuck with formulaic releases with nepotistic actors or lame attempts at imitating multiple western releases with the worst form of flattery.This one is a poor amalgamation of mindless gore, poor choreography, terrible acting, time reversing misogyny that does disservice to humanity through its existence.",negative
6,Too lengthy unnecessary episodes,"Too much violence, adult content. Strictly no kids.Can cut down to 2 hours.Hotel action episode, underwear episodes, zoya episode, Bobby deol introduction marriage episode making movie boring. Deviation from main plot.Actors good. Music good. Main plot good. Father theme song is so good. Bobby acting in introduction scene simply superb.There are no cops anywhere. Guns used like cell phones in everyone's hands. Flying to another country like Mumbai metro. Really ? Team did not sent movie to editing department it seems. Any new production house, new director will trim length easily.Ranabir one man show.",negative
5,Ranbir's Rampage: A Bollywood Odyssey Through Blood and Bullets,"Brace yourselves, Bollywood aficionados, because Animal is here to test your cinematic endurance. This is no mere masala flick; it's a three-hour behemoth that throws everything at the wall, from gravity-defying stunts to enough slow-motion violence to make Tarantino blush. And at the center of it all stands Ranbir Kapoor, Bollywood's answer to Jason Bourne, if Jason Bourne had a penchant for melodrama and a questionable moral compass.Let's get the obvious out of the way: Animal is excessively violent. Heads explode, limbs fly, and blood splatters like a demented Jackson Pollock painting. But unlike its Hollywood counterparts, where violence is often sterile and sanitized, here it's raw, visceral, and disturbingly intimate. You'll wince, you'll squirm, and you might even close your eyes once or twice.Imagine a nonsensical plot that somehow manages to be both predictable and nonsensical, sprinkled with special effects that wouldn't impress a teething toddler.",negative
1,Started of well but got worse as it progressed,"I rarely watch Hindi movies given the the levels these have dropped to nowadays. But, I gave this movie a try yesterday. It started off well and then got worse and worse. Bad story line, bad direction. Ranbir Kappor had his moments but he is in no way a superstar, not even close. Just a hyped up star.Anil Kapoor's acting is good as is the lady who plays Ranbir's mom.Don't waste your time seeing this movie. Movies such as these start off with a good rating because of fans and propaganda and then reality strikes.I am back to my Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu movies and will probably see a Hindi movie in 2025, so as not take any risk again.",negative
2,"Unrealistic Violence promotion: Just to make ""feeling like a wow"" :p","In ""Animal,"" the predominant themes revolve around relentless killings, shootings, and murders, overshadowing any depth in the storyline. The film seems fixated on portraying the protagonist as a force of strength and violence, offering little in terms of character development or a compelling narrative arc. Unfortunately, the weak storyline fails to engage the audience beyond the visual spectacle of brutality.Reflecting a common trend in contemporary South Indian cinema, ""Animal"" embraces a depiction of unrealistic violence that has become somewhat formulaic. This choice might cater to certain audience expectations, but it detracts from the potential for a more nuanced and thought-provoking cinematic experience.Moreover, the inclusion of sexual dialogues seems more of an attempt to sustain audience attention. It raises questions about the reliance on such elements to compensate for narrative shortcomings. The film's eagerness to resort to sensationalism rather than exploring the intricacies of character relationships or a more sophisticated storyline feels like a missed opportunity.In conclusion, ""Animal"" may appeal to those seeking an adrenaline-fueled visual spectacle, but its overemphasis on violence, weak storyline, and reliance on sensational elements leave much to be desired for viewers seeking a more substantial cinematic experience.",negative
10,Amazing movie,"Awesome movie. BGM is amazing and must watch movie. Ranbir has played amazing role. Animal"" presents a riveting family drama, skillfully exploring power dynamics and consequences. Anil Kapoor's compelling portrayal of the patriarch, paired with Ranbir Kapoor and Bobby Deol's nuanced performances as conflicted sons, creates a captivating narrative.

3,Brilliant acting but at cost of a flawed story,"Rather than talking about the horrible storyline and unnecessary violence or problematic visuals, I would speak on the performance they actors have done. The actors have made sure the characters live up to their name which in fact makes the character so hateful. This was one of the most morally wrong movie one can portray in today's cinema which can easily influence today's youth. Ranbir Kapoor had done a brilliant job while overshadowing other star cast in the movie despite their importance by being some of the lethal characters. Not to mention the unwanted scenes of nudity, sexual abuse or harassment, and domestic violence that were completely irrelevant to the plot. Everything ends with a bloodied fight and soon to be continued as a sequel for more horrid violence. Acting is praiseworthy but the a problematic story ruins everything.",negative
1,Censor/Ban such crap!,"Sensible movies like omg 2 gets censored and has restrictions but such crap is glorified. The director should seriously go for therapy. His way of depicting women is degrading. Such movies will only encourage the youth negatively . These sort of violent and misogynistic movies should not be allowed to release only and should be shelved straight away.Promote more practical and sensible movies which encourages even the least educated person to correctly function in a society and make it a better and safer place for all, not such garbage which in the literal sense is just vulgar and ends up giving a headache.",negative
10,Welcome to the Animal Realm,"""Animal"" roars onto the screen with an unforgettable cast, marking Ranbir Kapoor's career-best performance, truly an unparalleled cinematic experience. Anil Kapoor and Rasmika Mandana complement the lead with brilliant portrayals, while Bobby Deol, though deserving more screen time, captivates when on screen.The film's strength lies in its straightforward yet compelling storyline, enhanced by unapologetic violence, gripping dialogues, and a riveting background score. ""Animal"" sets a new standard for Bollywood in crime, action, and thriller genres, leaving audiences immersed in its intensity throughout its lengthy runtime.Ranbir Kapoor's portrayal in ""Animal"" is nothing short of a cinematic revelation. His character is a raw embodiment of untamed instincts-unapologetic, instinctive in reactions, a fierce defender of family, and willing to go to any lengths for survival. The film effortlessly captures the essence of an animal's primal nature, showcasing Ranbir's character as a compelling force, adding a unique and captivating layer to the movie.While some may find the film lengthy, its captivating storyline overshadows any potential drawback. The absence of police and law adds to the film's brilliance, as including them might have diluted the creation of the intense 'animal realm.' ""Animal"" is not for the faint-hearted, catering to those who relish crime action and seek an awe-inspiring cinematic experience.In a rare scenario, articulating cons proves challenging, emphasizing how the overwhelming positives overshadow any minor concerns. ""Animal"" is a cinematic triumph, boldly establishing a new benchmark in Indian cinema.",positive

It was utter disgusting to start with also, It does not make sense for a movie with 3 hours and 21 minutes, with rubbish second half, though first half was brilliant.Ranbir was brilliant with his acting in first half..even due to poor scripting of second half his acting went down as well.Bobby was given just 5 minutes of role and that too of a dead could not understand it.Illogical sexual content in second half.Some of the action scenes were good though and some of the characters were useless as well, like shakti Kapoor, tripti dimri( don't know what happened after having sex too many times with Ranbir in second half).Movie was thrillibg in first half and same pathetic in second.",negative
8,Just get entertained - enjoy but not influenced.,"Most of the Humans like things which are not good for their very own health such as liquor, smoke, junk food etc.... This movie is also a classic example of that as per the Box Office numbers. Chances of anyone getting negatively influenced by the movie is very high and it will be a drawback on the society. These alpha male, full control type mindset over the other gender and dirty violence is the foremost characteristic and theme of the movie.Sandeep Reddy Vanga has maintained his style which is unique and always about that Alpha Male steryotype. The movie is entertaining and scores well on all aspects and my one word for each one is as follows:Music- Magical
Dialouges- Witty
Oomph factor- Soaring
Acting- Brilliance (All of them)
Action- HeavyComparing and Naming the film Animal is totally inappropriate as animals are made naturally to kill and that is done for their basic survival. But if humans beings become synonyms of animal then that's a major fall back on our evolution process up till now. This movie should be a clear example of what not to be.These are the types of movie which will be either loved or hated, I doubt there will be any middle path. Having said that its an amazing movie. Just get entertained - enjoy but not influenced.",positive
7,Bloody Bollywood,"Ranbir stole the show.....excellent background music. Bobby should have gotten more time in the film, which would have cut short the needless drama. More or less must watch for one time. Rasmika did well in given role. Bodyguards with Ranbir looked dapper throughout. Ranbir's gun scene was the highlight. Plane ride was pathetic as shown they flying around the world in a unrealistic manner. Overall a man dominated bloody Bollywood movie. Nevertheless, Ranbir has done the most violent role ever. Anil kapoor was simply being Anil Kapoor in the film. Let's wait for the part 2 and see what Ranbir 2.0 has to offer.",positive

Cringeworthy scenes.- 100%
Misogyny/ sexism/ degredation of of whole women kind - 100%
I seriously felt nauseated watching this . I wish this movie was never made. My hatred for the director grew no bounds after this. Every single person who loved this movie or was okay while watching this movie needs THERAPY. The director needs THERAPY in the first place. Me being a fan of action movies and even violent ones found this unbearable to watch . THIS MOVIE DISGUISESTED ME TO THE CORE.",negative
4,Please be attached with your kids,"The message I took from the film is a kid, specially a boy will always remember what his father did for him or how his relationship was with his father in childhood that with his mother. So a clear message for our generation, give your time to kids.And if love Ranbir acting go for it otherwise keep your brain aside and watch it. Anil sir, Upendra Limaye and other Marathi actors don't need any introduction neither needs to mention they are amazing as always. Director could have avoided few unnecessary scenes like scene in laundry. Songs like 'Arjun Vailly' are very well shot and crowd enjoy it. Overall, film is good but it could have been better with few more cuts. Awaiting for the sequel. 😊",negative
5,Brat Rich kid takes an easy excuse to bring out the Inner Criminal,"Well I watched the movie few days back
1. Director has taken an easy way out of showing the protagonist as a rich brat , hence very easy to get access to Guns and Goons.2. As middle class Indian I don't see so called Papa is busy theory .. our fathers are always busy working and we don't become criminal .3. The Father Som Angle is also wrongly shown .. would have been more apt if Father went on killing spree .4. Keeping aside the Mysgonistic storyline .. and Fabulous Music ..

The film introduces a diverse cast of endearing animal characters, each with its own unique personality, making it easy for audiences to connect and empathize with their journeys.The cinematography deserves special mention, as the filmmakers have beautifully captured the untamed beauty of the natural world. From lush forests to vast savannas, every frame is a visual treat, showcasing the intricate balance of ecosystems and the importance of coexistence.The narrative unfolds with a perfect mix of humor, adventure, and poignant moments, ensuring that both children and adults will find something to enjoy.

2,"Sexist, Toxic, Typical Revenge storyline",The director of this movie himself is a psycho and I don't understand why Sandeep Vanga wants to encourage male dominance and violence against women through his movies. And whats even wrong is he is justifying all this. May be Sandeep is just letting out his frustration against his wife through his movie.Also if you want to make a dark movie then you should have a strong background storyline (like we've seen in movies like Joker 2019) which was kind of missing. Being this brutal and violent is not justified. Unnecessary violence was pathetic.Also unnecessary vulgar scenes and dialogue even make this movie worst.Tbh I just liked the acting and few songs rest I just hated.,negative
9,Craft- Ranbir and background score- Exceptional!,"This movie is worth watching for what India is capable of in terms of craft of a director, the superb background score worth Oscar and hugely and immensely talented Ranbir Kapoor who was supported brilliantly by Radhika and Bobby Deol, both we wanted a bit more of but what an impact they leave esp Bobby Deol. Who can or has ever left a w impact this BIG for such a small roller. Yes It has a lot of violence and bloodshed and yes it shows no Law and Order but it's not reality, it's a movie and people who expected anything else from a 'A' rated movie promoted very honestly as violent should have stayed home and not watched it.It's a movie which will ve remembered as EPIc and Cult and broken all

1,A big nuisance. Spoils the society,"Useless movie from a psycho director. Ranbir acted well and justified for the character. But it's a bad movie. Too much violence, adult content- 100 times more than 'Arjun Reddy'/ 'Kabir Singh'. Delivers wrong message to teenagers and youth. Better to stop watching Sandeep Vanga future movies. Showed Father and Son sentiment in a horrible way. Audio will drill your ears. Overall, Guns, Sex, and a big beep. Once you come out of the theatre, behave like what you are how you are before watching this movie. If you carry the same attitude as director or hero character, you will end up your remain life in a jail. It gives a clear message that you no need to respect a woman if she is not your sister or mother.",negative
6,Falls Short of Expectations,"Could have been better. Bobby Deol's screen time was very limited, and I was disappointed by this. Unnecessary family drama, intimate, and violent scenes made it long and boring. Instead, they should've focused more on the story and Bobby's screenplay. Rashmika was only there for glamour; she lacked acting skills. It was challenging to differentiate between her crying and laughing. The story was not gripping enough, and a better ending was missing. After the final fight scene, another family drama was unnecessary; it should've ended there. The action scenes were top-notch. Ranveer and Bobby were killing it. Overall, an average film.",negative

Melbourne show was full..Credit where due, anil Kapoor has really transformed himself as a modern day actor, he doesn't over due it at all many actors of his time and he commands the screen even more as he ages. Really Really commendable I must say, anil Kapoor rocks...Damn what a master piece. Love how is it has been directed. Entry of Boby deol steal the show. Didn't even realised when 3.2hrs gone.

The scripting is so tight; they didn't waste a single minute and just throw us, the audience, into the action. The way they edited this movie in a non-linear way of storytelling complements the tension and suspense they create throughout the film. Also, Ranbir just owned the role. After witnessing his massive performance, I'm speechless. His performance alone makes this movie the best Indian cinema can offer to the world. I wish i can watch this movie again with the first time experience.",positive

These are the same people who would watch same action in Jawan and Pathan and love it but would hate on it in animal.

6,Overdone one-time actioner,"Before the intermission, this movie managed to make me be at the edge of my seat and experience some exhilarating action sequences and entrances. The base establishment of the storyline there also seemed to be really good, setting the scen for what to expect next.However, things quickly went down from there. After a really exciting half that made me not even check the time once, the second half did the exact opposite. From the introduction of the antagonist to the final fight between Ranbir Kapoor and Bobby Deol (as seen in the trailer) seemed too rushed and didn't really did justice to Bobby's character, who at the end felt like some two-bit gangster who just happened to be rich and could afford a few henchmen.My theory for that rushing is that the first half took way too much time going over little moments. The sexual scenes seemed to be a bit out of this world and quite extended (personally, I am not a big fan of these as they don't add anything significant, most of the time). However, the action sequences were timed really good and were exciting to watch, and the score just uplifted the experience.Ranbir's character was delved into with a considerable amount of detail, with frequent cuts being made back and forth between his different phases of life. That's where I spotted another problem - the lack of cohesion in the character sketches. There was just too much throwing around into different phases, without much valuable information provided by the character.I believe that this 'Father-Son' bond could have been much better portrayed if certain moments owing to why the son actually loves his father were displayed instead of the viewers' taking his word for it (which works but fails to connect at an emotional level).Now, coming back to the characters, as we reached the end, there were still a lot of gaps left in my mind regarding each character except Ranbir's, as others were just barely touched upon and not given much representation and background, but the biggest victim of this was Bobby Deol.Also, after the second half, the score suddenly became really average and I have to say, the sound mixing fell to a great level compared to the first half.Then coming onto the claims made by the director that he will show what violence actually looks like. Nothing like that happens at all, just basic, plain-old violence that you see in action movies.At the end, I would say that the biggest problem was development of characters, and still maintaining a runtime of 3h and 21min, which feels shockingly long after the intermission. This movie definitely has its moments but really doesn't seem to do much in departments other than action. The romantic part seems outworldly, and we cannot forget the director's staple, misogyny (not trying to sound like some protester, but unnecessarily portraying it doesn't seem to save this movie and doesn't make sense too).Overall, the cinematography was really basic, songs were good but the direction, storytelling, character development (especially in the case of Anil Kapoor and Bobby Deol) could have been much better.",negative
7,Not for everyone.,"The first half was amazing. It entertained with a gush of adrenaline. The second half was absolute mess. The negatives of movie - some parts are comedy at low tendency that to feel the tone of movie, but the dark humor was good. The runtime I felt could be easily cut shot by 1 hour, there were unnecessary moments in the 2nd half which I didn't get connected to. I thought the melodrana could be written in an even better way. Rashmika was literally annoying on screen. It's way too much raw, not all people can digest. Postives - Everyone's acting except for Rashmika. The climax of hero and father bond was absolutely superb. (Can make you teary-eyed). The interval bang. Lord Bobby's screen presence, he sometimes over shadowed Ranbir. The pre-interval sequence was too good.",positive
9,"Animal"" - The Revolution in India Film Industry.","""Animal,"" directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, unfolds as a gripping narrative of power dynamics, deception, and familial bonds. The movie features a stellar cast, including Ranbir Kapoor, Rashmika Mandana, Anil Kapoor, Bobby Deol, and Shakti Kapoor, each contributing to the film's overall intensity.The screenplay stands out as a cornerstone of the film, weaving a complex and engrossing storyline that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The seamless integration of a compelling background score, coupled with songs that organically align with the narrative, enhances the overall cinematic experience.Ranbir Kapoor delivers a tour de force performance, showcasing his versatility as an actor. His portrayal of the central character adds layers to the storyline, capturing the essence of the character's journey with finesse. Anil Kapoor, in a role that demands nuance and authority, delivers a standout performance, reminding audiences of his commanding on-screen presence.While Bobby Deol's performance is noteworthy, the film could have benefitted from allocating more screen time to explore his character's depth further. Nevertheless, his presence adds a layer of intrigue to the ensemble cast.The cinematography and production design deserve accolades for creating a visually compelling world that complements the film's narrative. The director's vision is palpable in every frame, guiding the audience through a labyrinth of emotions, suspense, and unexpected twists.As the credits roll, the anticipation for a sequel lingers, a testament to the film's ability to leave audiences hungry for more. ""Animal"" is a masterclass in storytelling, with a powerhouse cast delivering memorable performances. It's a must-watch for those who appreciate intense narratives, compelling characters, and a cinematic experience that lingers long after leaving the theater.",positive
10,Masterpiece,"What a Movie ! The Acting, Direction, Story Line, Screen Play, Dialogue Deliveries, Songs, Background Music everything was top notch.Kudos to Sandeep Reddy Vanga. The Complex Father Son relationship, he explained in such a beautiful manner. Didn't feel for a single moment that the screen time was over 3 hrs. I literally enjoyed every moment of the movie. It can't be better.An excellent comeback by Lord Bobby. Anil Kapoor, Rashmika Mandanna, Triptii Dimri, Shakti Kapoor everyone did their role very well.Ranbir Kapoor never stop to amaze me with his spectacular acting skill and versatility. This movie was completely out of his genre. But he completely nailed the role. After Dilip Kumar, Rajesh Khanna, Amitabh Bacchan, Shah Rukh Khan, now it is time to acknowledge Ranbir Kapoor as the ""King of Bollywood"".A complete 10 on 10 from my side. A true master piece by bollywood.",positive

10,This film is gold !,"A very well directed marvel. Touched many chords depicting the father son bond, and the whirlpool a family could be. Every minute of the movie was gripping. Absolutely loved the film ! More power to such film makers. May your tribe keep growing.As far as the violence is concerned, it is an A rated film for a reason. And if the A rated audience can enjoy Kill Bill then this film is certainly not an outlier in that respect.Brilliant acting by the cast. Every character was well thought out and placed in the film to strengthen the story line. Excellent plot twists and over all this Ranbir Kapoor has my heart.",positive
1,What a Comedy Genre!!,"This movie genre is comedy actually...So called protogonist who is actually an antagonist does everything that a human with psychological medical disorders do, all the lady in the movie want is Sex! The film tries to emotionally tag it as father's love and he never listens to his father and never does what his father likes... He complains of not getting attention from his father and leaves his kids for weeks without a clue where he is and just comes back, the lady says you never take care of kids,
....!! I understand he is training his Son to be a Jr. Animal...That pre interval fight with an outdated Shooter machine used umpteen in South movies, firing hundreds and remember in parallel world there exists no police n law..You can kill like PubG...The narrative contradicts it's own statements..One scene Vijay says, if I reveal about how many times we are involved in sex you will get scared...and wife keeps on complaining Do you even Rembember when was the last time we did! Vanga is obsessed with Underpants, men's urine, and chaddi jokes...If you observe the Bro code understanding, men looking at other man's nude body and having smiles and blues,...I shouldn't be saying much about the directors orientation.... If you have literally No talent and worth in making a movie,.....put Violence and sex as two easiest elements that touch any class of audience that's it... comedy works...",negative
9,Kya baat kya baat kya baat,"Animal is a top notch gangsta movie with all the necessary elements in the right amount. Great to see Ranbir Kapoor in such a challenging role and the way he transformed himself from the chocolate boy of Sawaariya to the beast he becomes in animal is applaudable. And so good to see Lord Bobby back on the big screen doing roles that suits his personality. Rasmika is good. Anil kapoor does justice to his role. Sandeep Reddy Vanga delivers a masterpiece once again. This film will keep you wanting for more and even the 3 hour length didn't seem like a problem. If you are a fan of good action with a blend of violence and bloodshed, this movie is for you.",positive
10,Definitely a Manly Movie,Watching the movie definitely makes our Indian men cultural to ensure our women's and family members are very important. Distance doesn't matter when the family comes first and also friends are certainly important in anyone life's even if the reasons and distance and communication gap is there... Friends are truly helpful in this agony world. Some scenes are definitely needed to be crafted out and show them out public..Movie definitely had a family connection and giving again a chance to get better only a family connection thinks . Good acting by Ranbir and definitely hats off to VangaWatching again.,positive
5,RANBIR KAPOOR,"Ranbir Kapoor and Sandeep RV deliver an action packed and Violent movie and with the most amazing CLIMAX. Must watch.BOBBY DEOL kills it with his looks.Supporting cast is amazing and have done an amazing job.No one could imagine Ranbir in such a Violent role but he pulled it off with such ease. One of the best actors of our generation.Rating this movie high is necessary because Unlike Pathaan, Jawan and Tiger, this movie is actually a mass entertainer where the actor has done a phenomenal job and in a good story. Jawan only earned so much because of SRK. That movie was trash. ANIMAL ALL THE WAY.",negative
10,Best of December,"""Animal,"" starring Ranbir Kapoor, offers a gripping cinematic experience. Kapoor's nuanced portrayal of a complex character adds depth to the narrative. The film seamlessly weaves together suspense, drama, and emotion, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats. The cinematography, coupled with a compelling soundtrack, enhances the overall impact. While the storyline might be intense, Kapoor's performance and the film's production quality make it a must-watch for fans of thrilling, character-driven cinema.The side characters were also great like rashmika mandana and Anil kapoor. It was amazing.",positive
7,Not worth the hype,"Animal is a full violent, action and drama film with lots of vulgar scenes and kisses. Movie is fine but not great. The hype this movie's trailer made in public was just great but the film may disappoint you if you carry too many expectations. Performance of the whole cast was great especially Ranbir Kapoor was terrific, even Rashmika Mandhaana who was getting trolled for her dialouge delivery in a particular scene of the trailer was just great in this film. I loved the climax of the movie and I am sure you will also love it and the whole interval block was awesome. I could not blink during the interval block because it was very good. Overall a good movie if you want some entertainment.",positive
10,Outstanding movie,"My head is an animal...,"" goes a line in a famous song from the Icelandic band Of Monsters and Men. Sandeep Reddy Vanga's protagonists - thick-headed creatures of privilege and entitlement - are all badly-behaved men who could easily pass for monsters. After Arjun Reddy (2017) and Kabir Singh (2019), two films about a chain-smoking doctor with anger issues, the director returns with Animal, his second Hindi feature, about a chain-smoking engineer with deep-seated daddy issues. Yet no matter how bleak and paleolithic his view of human instincts, he also wants us to stand in awe of his heroes, even admire and empathise with them.ALSO.",positive
8,Bloody Beast,"Ranbir Kapoor delivers a commanding performance in ""Animal,"" skillfully navigating the intricate dynamics of father-son relationships and the pursuit of revenge. Kapoor's stellar portrayal is complemented by Bobby Deol's phenomenal turn in a negative role, adding a compelling layer to the narrative. Deol's nuanced performance brings a sinister charisma, creating a captivating dynamic with Kapoor's character. Anil Kapoor's admirable portrayal as a father further enhances the film's emotional resonance, contributing significantly to the ensemble cast's standout performances. Together, they make ""Animal"" a cinematic triumph, seamlessly intertwining intense drama, powerful action, and multifaceted storytelling.",positive
7,Good watch,"Though the film is over long in terms of runtime it doesnt feel like over streched or boring. The screenplay was crisp. The characterizations were good, technically the film is brilliant. The biggest assets of the film are performances and background score. Ranbir gave one of his career best performances. Rashmika did well in her role. Personally i loved watching her in this one. Bobby deol was amazing. Others were good in their roles Background score elevated the movie watching experience for sure. Interval block action sequence will be a treat for masses. On negative sides, Im not sure if i can rewatch the film again... Its beacuse i couldnt connect with the story much in the 2nd half. The whole track of tripti dimri looked dull and silly. The post credit scene was menacing but felt unnecessary. And so is interval block. It was surely choreographed well but... Why?... Why people have to come like in waves like in a video game. Ending didnt work for me...
Final verdict is I'll definitely recommend you to give it a try though i cant watch it again myself.",positive
1,Worst movie,"""Animal"" was one of the most highly anticipated movies of 2023, but unfortunately, it failed to live up to its potential. The film's storyline was widely criticized for being convoluted and lacking coherence, leaving audiences bewildered and dissatisfied. From the very beginning, it was clear that ""Animal"" was going to be a wild ride, but instead of being thrilling, it turned out to be a mess.One of the biggest issues with ""Animal"" was its storytelling. The plot seemed to jump from one random scene to another without any clear direction or purpose. Characters appeared and disappeared without any explanation, making it difficult for viewers to invest in their stories. The lack of a cohesive narrative made it hard to follow the movie's logic, and many viewers found themselves scratching their heads trying to make sense of what was happening on screen.In addition to its weak storytelling, ""Animal"" also relied heavily on shock value and gratuitous violence to keep audiences engaged. While some viewers might enjoy this type of content in moderation, ""Animal"" took it to the extreme, bombarding viewers with graphic scenes that felt unnecessary and gratuitous. Instead of adding depth to the story or characters, these scenes came across as cheap attempts to shock and titillate audiences.Another major flaw of ""Animal"" was its lack of character development. The film introduced a slew of characters, but none of them were given enough screen time or depth to make a lasting impression. As a result, viewers struggled to connect with any of the characters, making it hard to care about their fates or the outcome of the story.On top of all these issues, ""Animal"" also suffered from poor pacing and editing. The movie seemed to drag on at times, with scenes that felt unnecessarily long and drawn out. This sluggish pace made it even harder for viewers to stay engaged, and many found themselves losing interest long before the credits rolled.In conclusion, ""Animal"" was a major disappointment and easily one of the worst movies of 2023. Its convoluted storyline, gratuitous violence, lack of character development, and poor pacing all contributed to its downfall. While some viewers might enjoy mindless action and violence, ""Animal"" failed to deliver even on those fronts, leaving audiences with a bitter taste and a feeling of wasted potential.",negative
1,I can't believe this won awards,"Apparently bollywood must have lowered their standards in what they call acting. A movie of 3 hours of violence and fighting is not classified as a good movie. The sad part is this movie is based on an unrealistic story that should not be put in brains of society with the current state of the world. This movie goes in a sci-fi type category and should have lost money like no other. The acting was horrible, the story was horrible, and by the end you realized you wasted 3.5 hours of your life that you will unfortunately never see again! Save yourself time and watch the first 5 mins and the last 2 and you will understand the entire move. You don't need to waste your precious life on this pathetic direction/acting.",negative
10,Dreams and Knightmares of Snowflakes,"Kill the messenger..and the message is what everyone wants to hear.Watched Animal in a packed theatre. The toxic masculinity, shades of patriarchy, misogyny that has been told to be glorified; is actually the impeccable acting by Ranbir, that made everyone hate him so much that they loved watching him. As for glorification, the sequences are so unreal, any movie goer would understand it is just a made up story, and not blindly follow Ranbir's character. And all the sane characters except Ranbir and Lord Bobby, knew the right from wrong, and constantly reminded Ranbir, Bobby and the audiences, that they were toxic dogs.However, there lies the magic. The story is so out of the world and bonkers that I loved it. First half was a Hong kong Adrenaline action flick, and second half was a South Korean action drama on Testosterone. It was 1990's Agneepath on acid. The subplots were stretched, but they were necessary to set up the character and the universe around him. Rashmika had one scene to showcase her acting and she gave her best. The most trolled scene in the trailer, and somehow I loved it. Anil Kapoor had his moments. Lord Bobby was one of the baddest villains to appear in a Bollywood film after such a long time, wish he had longer screen time. The two action sequences were beautifully choreographed. The BGMs were hauntingly beautiful. I mean ""Arjan Vailly"" was an inferno!!The slow transition from one scene to another without quick cuts and edits were reminiscent of old school filmmaking. I have seen the kind often in Spaghetti Westerns. The blood and gore was over the top, just the way I like it. From the first scene, till the end, it was bloody engaging. The breaking of the fourth wall in the end was disrespectful and challenging, and also made me laugh, I mean everyone in the theatre was laughing.Everyone enjoyed the movie, they clapped, all are hyped for the sequel. The negative word of mouth was strategic. Don't stop crying. Don't stop filing petitions 😂. It's not just a movie. It's a beast. 😂",positive
5,Entertaining but not agreeable !!! Can't say it's a very good movie.,"Amazing direction, capable of keeping veiwers hooked on to screen, amazing acting by each and everyone. And a beautiful basis for the story - appealing son's desire for his father's attention and love. And the character is just that of title or rather becoming of the title in the process of wanting that love.Rashmika's screen presence is limited but whatever scenes she enacts, it superb acting that it doesn't feel can be carried by any other actress.Ranbir's acting is very good but also feels that in current league of actors could also have been carried by the likes of Ranveer singh, Vicky Kaushal, Varun Dhawan, shahid Kapoor. But that certainly cannot undermine his prowess in showcasing acting skills and they are just what needs to be.The first half of movie is convincing , however not being comfortable with the typical Vanga's showcasing of women as dust. Later part becomes a kind of dragged putting in some surprises but which feel unwanted or not being so connected to story.The portrayal of a sect of religion is in a way not so respectable. And that needs to be corrected.Vanga needs to come out of this league of showing men dominating women, treating them solely for own selfish reason and having no say. This is in line with Kabir Singh and hence most of viewers wouldn't agree and becomes a downfall.Over all movie plot is good, could be reduced in time and could have been made more convincing.",negative
4,A teenage fever dream,"This movie was made for bunch of teens and men with teen mentality. Fails in terms of storytelling, narrative or any depth at all. Features lot of unnecessary scenes and actions, they could've easily cut down 15-20mins of the film. I'm not even gonna get into the misogyny part and how it's perpetuating these harmful ideas in today's society. Lot of sex jokes being forced on the audience in attempt to draw laughter out of kids and immature audience. Throughout the film, it felt I was watching a movie made by a teen and this is how he imagine what it's like to be a grown man. You cannot convince me.",negative
7,Movies are movies. Idealism comes afterwards,"Reading all these negative reviews, it seems to me that audiences want a movie's main protagonist to be a Superman like character with his morals and justifications but there is no person who is like Superman in our world.This movie is not about Superman or an anti hero with principles like Batman. This movie is about a complicated character who has a large heap of emotional scars and a rough psychological upbringing. It shows a mirror into our societies where being a good father meant a stern, strict commanding figure and a good son meant a submissive, disciplined overall good boy.It film doesn't want you to love this character or idealize him, it's up to us. The movie is showing us the flaws to this character and peak into his psyche in order to get an understanding of where he is coming from.People suppress what they want to say to their parents their whole live. Movies rarely show us the dark sides of a relationship and why co dependent toxic relationships seem to exist for so long. Men dealing with their inadequacies.The movie is showing us the realities of our current society.Also, this is a commercial movies aimed to earn a lot of money. The added action, violence and added cameos are sprinkles to illustrate the themes I've mentioned above.Overall I was fully entertained by this movie.",positive
2,Blatant attempt to rip-off Maula Jatt,"If you want to watch a movie about revenge, a menacing villain, a psychotic protagonist and lots of booodlust, no intervention from police and a violent uninterrupted showdown built on a story of family pride, love and honour with the essence of Punjab flowing through...then just watch Maula Jatt instead. This steaming pile of nonsensical, disjointed, horribly paced, edited and choreographed mess isn't worth wasting your time on. The only good thing about it is the soundtrack so just listen to that and save yourself the torture of sitting through this.There's no central theme, there's no catharsis, no purpose of so many major plot points and a twist that has absolutely no purpose in advancing anything other than the option of making a sequel.",negative
8,Ranbir Kapoor shines with career best performance in Sandeep Reddy Vanga's gutsy and unhinged 'Animal',"Animal Movie review:Phew!! Where to start!! Let's just say that if you take the character of Kabir Singh, multiply him by a 1000 and then put him in a Godfather-esque family business rivalry storyline, you get 'Animal'. This movie has the stamp of Sandeep Reddy Vanga from start to finish and boy he wasn't kidding when he said 'I will show you what violence is' a few years back. And this movie is not at all for the faint-hearted. The lines between a Protagonist and an Antagonist have never been blurred as much before. The relationships, be it a father-son or a husband-wife one, have never been as toxic before. At one point, you just wonder whom the Movie's title is referring to. Is it the Father, the son or the character of Bobby Deol (played deliciously by him) or is the whole situation and environment around the characters just an 'Animal Park' where one is vying for the blood of the other at the slightest opportunity? The story revolves around Balbir Singh (played by Anil Kapoor), who is a steel business tycoon and his son played by Ranbir Kapoor (apparently his name itself is kind of a spoiler) and the conflicts they have had with one another since childhood and the complications that arise as a result of this very dark relationship. One day, when Balbir Singh gets shot in an assination attempt, his son goes on a revenge path to find out the perpetrator who shot the 'Greatest, if not the Best, Hero' of his life. With this as the basic plot, Vanga delves deep into the psyche of his characters and herein the Director shines the most. There are some scenes, so memorable, so beautifully shot that you are left with awe and admiration. The pre-interval action sequnece is one of the best scenes ever filmed for an Indian film with brilliant choreography, masterful editing in that part and aided by some adrenaline rushing BGM. However, more than the action and gore, which is plentiful, it's the dialogues and scenes between characters that elevate this movie more. The father-son dynamic is especially very complex. There is anger and a frustrating hatred between the two but also unbounded love, born directly from a toxic childhood which makes Ranbir's character continue to seek validation from Balbir Singh even as an adult and Balbir Singh just refuses to acknowledge his son, although the movie doesn't evidently project this as a bad thing. Even some scenes between Ranbir's character and his wife played by Rashmika borders on insanity and full-blown toxicity. At times, I could not comprehend how and why they are still together. Yet these are the moments Vanga chooses his characters to portray- raw, unapologetic emotions without hiding behind any farce. As long as the characters are not taken in the sense of being role-models (which they are absolutely not) of a father, son, husband or even a wife, the movie is extremely well-made. Ranbir Kapoor showcases a powerhouse performance which is just mind-blowing. Ranbir puts forth his career best performance by giving it his all for this character. His rage, his cries, his helplessness are all portrayed brilliantly through eyes, body language and dialogues. His scenes with Anil Kapoor are particularly hearfelt and touching which most Indian men will surely be able to relate to. Anil Kapoor also delivers an excellent performance. Rashmika Mandana does a wonderful job as well, although sometimes her dialogues are difficult to understand. But the character of Bobby Deol just steals the show right from his first frame to his last. I just wished we could have seen a lot more of him. The writing for Bobby deol's character was heavily uncooked and Vanga clearly missed a big opportunity there. The rest of the cast do a commendable job as well. The Background Music is brilliant, pulsating and adrenaline pumping. The songs are very good, I personally love this album. The Cinematography is beautiful. However, there are many questions left unanswered in terms of many 'negative' character motivations but there has been enough room left for a sequel to continue this story forward.Animal is a very violent, raw, gory, shocking and unapologetic movie. It wears its heart on its sleeves and at 3 hours and 21 mins it does test your patience at times. But it deserves watching especially due to its direction, morally grey characters and its performances. And by no means, is this a movie to learn from how to be a good son or a good father. It's all just Alpha. So if you are a person who is triggered very easily, you may hate what Animal has to offer.But if you do decide to watch it, stick around till the credits roll and there is a big surprise. Personally, I loved the experience and the feels it generated within me.",positive

1,Imagine spending 3.5 hours in torture chamber with rats crawling over you - that sums the movie,"I regret having spent 3.5 hours of my life on this utter garbage of a movie. First 30 mins are fine, rest of the movie is just disconnected montage of gory pointless violence and most disgustingly thought up cliches. There is absolutely no depth of characters.It's shocking the way in which the movie normalises physical abuse of women, toxic masculinity and insulting of mental health professionals. Dialogues have been inserted purely for the shock value. Anil Kapoor's talent is wasted. This is the kind of utter garbage that contributes to some horrific real life crimes that we see so frequently in our cities. Sandeep Reddy Vanga bro, if you are reading this, please have some shame and dont make such abhorrent garbage just because you can!",negative

Possibly the people who are criticizing the movie know nothing about screenplay, direction, acting & storytelling, because all these things were wonderfully done in this movie. Brilliant work done by the director & all the actors. I gave this 10 stars because according to the story and plot, everything was perfect & I don't see any scope for improvement.

10,A brilliant movie not made for selfish and cold people.,This movie is a brilliant cinematic experience as people with emotions can really understand the pain and love of ranbir kapoor as ranvijay singh. His acting is outstanding the songs are placed quite beautifully. Over all this movie gives you a mesmerizing experience and even though it's a 3 hour and 22 minutes long movie. There is not a single dull moment in the movie but again people who have deep emotions can understand that how much he loved his father as he gave everything and in the end there was a moment when he truly felt helpless and cried like a baby on the shoulder of his uncle.

However, a word of caution to those planning a family outing - this movie is not for the faint-hearted, with its abundance of bold scenes that might catch you off guard.Now, let's dive into what truly makes ""Animal"" a cinematic triumph. The ensemble cast delivers a performance of the highest caliber, with each actor bringing their A-game to the table. Ranbir Kapoor's portrayal is nothing short of exceptional; he not only meets but exceeds expectations. His ability to immerse himself in the character adds an extra layer of authenticity to the film.The emotional rollercoaster reaches its peak in the last scene, leaving the audience teary-eyed and deeply moved. It's a testament to the director Sandeep Reddy Vanga's mastery in storytelling and emotional resonance. Bobby Deol, too, shines brightly with his impeccable acting, proving yet again that he is a force to be reckoned with in the industry.As the credits roll, an unexpected twist awaits in the post-credit scene. Regrettably, some in the cinema missed out on this crucial moment, but I implore you not to make the same mistake.",positive
10,The craziest and the most badass Indian movie Animal-,"The craziest and the most badass Indian movie that will ever be experienced by the audience on the screen so far since 110 years. Definitely falls under ""The Cult"" category.The boldest director Sandeep Vanga Reddy takes us through the journey of a Son's possessiveness towards his Dad to the volcanic extreme, that he is just replacing love with vengeance, peace with war, gentleness with rage and saneness with madness.Most of the scenes are original and never seen before.Ranbir Kapoor stuns you with the most complex character, and your jaw will be dropped with shock and awe for his mind boggling acting along with various emotions stampede. He just tears open the cinema screen with his brilliance and ease, as he transforms from a raging teenager to animal man, and there is no stopping even with a meteor.This marks him as the best actor of Indian cinema with a launchpad to reach the elites.Having to match him is no easy feat but Rashmika Mandanna does it elegantly with stubbornness and guts.Anil Kapoor is a class apart with his stature and maturity.Bobby Deol is back with a bang. He delivers his career best performance although his screen presence is very short (a bit disappointing).The story is uniquely presented with full heart and woven really well with astounding screenplay and terrific music.Strictly for 18+ years. The alpha man kicks in, with no good social message. Pure violence, rampage and massacre in parts.Wish some uncomfortable scenes were edited, and also movie duration trimmed (first part of second half) as its 3 hours 22 mins long.Animal movie cracks open the movie industry with the boldness and crookedness, and roars loud.Watch at your own risk!",positive

Lots of blood, shooting and swearing which makes a movie feel raw. You've also got to appreciate the way the ending was rolled out. Leaves the viewers minds open to interpretation.

1,"Yuckest Story, acting , dialogues, direction! hope people see Venga in mall and ask him to suck @##$","""Animal"" is an absolute disaster in the world of cinema. This film, if it can even be called that, is a cringe-inducing experience from start to finish. The acting is so abysmal that it makes you question the casting director's sanity. The performances are wooden and devoid of any emotion, as if the actors were reading their lines for the first time.The story, or lack thereof, is a convoluted mess that seems to have been stitched together by a preschooler with a pair of safety scissors. It's impossible to follow, and any attempt to make sense of the plot is met with frustration and disbelief. The narrative is a chaotic jumble of disconnected scenes that leave the audience scratching their heads in confusion.To make matters worse, ""Animal"" relies heavily on gratuitous violence and explicit sexual language, attempting to compensate for its lack of substance with shock value. It's a desperate and misguided attempt to grab attention that only serves to alienate viewers who were unfortunate enough to endure this cinematic travesty. Save yourself the agony and steer clear of ""Animal"" at all costs.",negative
2,Utter waste of time,"I really don't understand how this movie has got so many ward nominations, I have given 2 stars for this movie that is just because of the 2 good songs in it otherwise it does not even deserve rating also.Likes:
1. Two songs Papa meri jaan and Pehle bhi main are good to the ears.2. There was not for Anil Kapoor to do in this movie but whatever his part was, he looked in it.3. Nothing to take away from Ranvir Kapoor and Bobby Deol, story and direction was so poor that good actors could not save this disaster.Dislikes: After wasting 3 hours watching this movie, I don't want to talk much about it waste more time on this. But I will still give few points so you can save your time not watching it.1. This is a very lengthy movie.2. In one scene when Ranvir and Rashmika were fighting about Ranvir having sexual relation with another women, dialogues used in this scene shows the class of dialogue writer. The questions Rashmika was asking didn't make any sense. I simply felt dialogue writer was horny while writing this dialogue or in fact in the whole movie itself.3. Th intent of the storyline may have been showcasing father-son relation and love, but the way story was told it turned out to be son is psycho.4. It promotes gun, violence, sex so it is not to watch with family or kids.",negative

1,Waste of time and money,Simply 3rd class. The numbers and hype created is simply fake. Felt like a modern version of earlier time South Indian movies with no logic only action and this is much worse than that also. Acting wise Anil Kapoor did a good job. Didn't understand how people are even evaluating Bobby Deol performance as his screen time is lesser than Ranbir's body guards. The movie not only had a very poor script but its screen play and post production edit is also pathetic. This kind of movies should not be allowed to release even with an A rated certificate as it contains all the bad things that should one avoid. Very pathetic movie.,negative
10,Amazing,"Animal"" a movie from which i expected a lot (as people were saying its going to change indian cinema) It is a nice movie you can go to theatre grab some popcorns enjoy the first half with brilliant BGM, Action And ranbir kapoor's amazing acting skills that Adrenaline rush just amazing the story was also going nice. As the second half starts the action starts fading away and people starts having full conversion that you barely see in first half Some of the dialogues in the movie are very nicely written medical terms used very aptly that dilogue about swastik and Nazi symbol (detailing)Amazing!! ..",positive
5,Below average,"If you are someone who loves to watch thoughtful movies, then please don't waste your time. For people who are only watching for weekend timepass or have came to theatre because of Ranveer and Bobby, this movie even for them fails to deliver. The first half of movie is bit engaging but in second half things are just happening. There is no build up, no climax, or no particular thing that hits you and you come out of theatre with that thing in your mind, nothing. Though you won't find this ""unique"" thing in first half also. Things look like they are inspired from old 2000s Indian movies, where movie is rushed to complete events one after another, even if they are not making much sense. Even dialogues and characters are not strong, this is just so disappointing for a 3 and half hour movie to have such an impact in the end.",negative
10,"Great Direction, Awesome Acting, Fantabulous movie to watch..","Ranbir and Bobby Deol were awesome in terms of acting...Story was great and The music and songs were fantabulous..The day i saw the teaser and Trailer of this movie, i was damn sure its gonna hit the Box office very hard..Ranbir Kapoor is back with the bang after Rajneeti movie..When we talk about Lord Bobby Deol, he was just awesome in this movie..I mean the looks he gave in this movie, cant describe. Now we talk about the music, Harshvardhan Rameshwar gave the fantabulous background music in this movie..There were goosebumps in terms of Background score when j was watching this movie in the theatre..and above all The Director of this filmSandeep Reddy Vanga, he was awesome, great in terms of story, editing, and direction..",positive
9,Good Movie action like hollywood,"Shown a good gun and fight scenes and Overall movie is entertaining. You're looking to transform that review for a film titled ""Blood Red"" into one for a film named ""Animal,"" right? Here's a revised version:""Animal"" is a visceral rollercoaster that plunges audiences headfirst into a gripping underworld saga. Directed by a maestro of intensity, this Bollywood masterpiece fearlessly delves into the darkest corners of the human psyche, etching an unforgettable impression on viewers.Set against the sprawling canvas of a metropolis, the film traces the daunting odyssey of a man consumed by an unquenchable thirst for retribution. Raw emotions and unbridled violence entwine as the protagonist navigates a treacherous terrain of betrayal and deceit. The narrative fearlessly dives into the abyss of human nature, unveiling the extremes one would traverse to seek justice in an unjust world.Visually stunning yet relentlessly gritty, ""Animal"" fearlessly portrays the stark reality of its themes. The cinematography captures the pulsating energy of the underworld, juxtaposing serene moments with explosive, bone-crushing action sequences. The choreography of the fight scenes orchestrates a symphony of chaos, leaving the audience breathless amid the whirlwind of violence.At its essence, the film is a deep character study, delving into the intricate psyche of its protagonist whose pursuit of vengeance becomes an all-consuming obsession. The lead delivers a powerhouse performance, channeling a mix of rage, vulnerability, and unyielding determination that lingers long after the movie ends.Yet, ""Animal"" isn't flawless. Its unrelenting brutality might estrange certain viewers, and at times, the pacing falters, lingering excessively on scenes of aggression. While the narrative grips you, it occasionally teeters on the edge of predictability, following familiar tropes of revenge tales.Nevertheless, for aficionados of gritty cinema, ""Animal"" offers an experience that reverberates in the mind. It's a bold exploration of the human condition, painted with shades of vengeance and redemption against an unflinching backdrop of violence.To sum up, ""Animal"" is not for the faint-hearted. It's an unapologetic, unfiltered plunge into the depths of vengeance, brought to life with intense performances and captivating visuals. While it may not cater to everyone's taste, for those willing to embrace its brutality, it stands as a cinematic tour de force that leaves an enduring mark.",positive
6,Don't get fooled by the trailer which makes more sense than the movie,"1st half is good and engaging.2nd half is more of vanga trying to force dialogues, sub plots to ensure controversies are created..which is still fine if it made any logical sense. At times it was boring too.The issue is the film hardly makes any sense after the first half.Bobby deol was totally underused and so is his plot. But he shines in whatever screen time he got.Ranbir kapoor acted the same throughout..there was hardly much difference in the pitch of his character from childhood till he comes the animal. Hardly could see the dashavatar of his acting as claimed by vanga. He was wasted in a way. Although he does full justice to what he was asked to do.All in all the trailer made more sense than the movie. The violence shown is nothing to be afraid of..if you are watching OTT stuff.Nowhere close a film which can be called pathbreaking as some are claiming.",negative
9,Good,"As December draws to a close, there's no doubt that ""Animal"" has clinched the title of the best movie of 2023. The anticipation was sky-high, fueled by the intriguing trailer that promised a powerful Father and Son bond. However, a word of caution to those planning a family outing - this movie is not for the faint-hearted, with its abundance of bold scenes that might catch you off guard.Now, let's dive into what truly makes ""Animal"" a cinematic triumph. The ensemble cast delivers a performance of the highest caliber, with each actor bringing their A-game to the table. Ranbir Kapoor's portrayal is nothing short of exceptional; he not only meets but exceeds expectations. His ability to immerse himself in the character adds an extra layer of authenticity to the film.The emotional rollercoaster reaches its peak in the last scene, leaving the audience teary-eyed and deeply moved. It's a testament to the director Sandeep Reddy Vanga's mastery in storytelling and emotional resonance. Bobby Deol, too, shines brightly with his impeccable acting, proving yet again that he is a force to be reckoned with in the industry.As the credits roll, an unexpected twist awaits in the post-credit scene. Regrettably, some in the cinema missed out on this crucial moment, but I implore you not to make the same mistake. It's in these final moments that ""Animal"" transcends from a great film to an absolute masterpiece. Sandeep Reddy Vanga has crafted a narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very last second.In conclusion, ""Animal"" is not just a movie; it's an experience that will linger in your thoughts long after leaving the cinema. The bold scenes may not be suitable for family viewing, but for those who appreciate powerful storytelling, exceptional acting, and unexpected twists, this is a film that demands your attention. Sandeep Reddy Vanga has indeed created a masterpiece that cements ""Animal"" as the best movie of 2023.",positive
10,Appreciable performances by all characters,"Animal is a movie that does not shy away from showing the dark and ugly side of human nature. It is a story of a father and son who are both ruthless, violent and power-hungry, and the women who get caught in their web of lies and deceit. The movie is also a showcase of Ranbir Kapoor's acting prowess, as he plays the role of Vijay, the son of a notorious gangster, played by Anil Kapoor. Ranbir delivers a stunning performance as a man who is driven by his obsession, hatred and lust for his father's empire. He portrays a character who is complex, unpredictable and terrifying, and yet somehow manages to evoke some sympathy from the audience. The movie is not without its flaws, however. The movie is too long, with a runtime of over three hours, and some scenes feel unnecessary and repetitive. The movie also lacks depth and substance, as it does not explore the motivations or backgrounds of the characters, or the social and political implications of their actions. The movie also relies too much on shock value and sensationalism, and does not offer any meaningful message or insight. The movie is not without its flaws, however.

7,Violence at top notch,Video of the movie is very stunning also the song choreography is very good also the action is very new in Indian cinema and all over the film is very very beautifully captured. The film suited three hour and 27 minutes long but when you watch the full movie in the theatre Feel it's like too much length you enjoying the whole movie you enjoying the Ranbir Kapoor acting the Anil Kapoor acting and the lobby they were role was only 15 minutes in the movie but still it's very way away from the cinema angle so you should must watch this movie in theatre this year don't keep movie don't see this movie at home just go to the theatre.,positive
1,Watch this film and beg for a refund!,"3 hours and 22 minutes of my life wasted. Stupidity! Misogyny! Incorrect depictions of Muslims! Objectified women, unnecessary plot twists, horrible pacing - this movie only succeeded in giving me nightmares as a thriller would, except not for the gore, but the sheer disappointment it proved itself to be. Avoid watching this film unless you're looking to write a caustic review such as this one - the villain was revealed in the last few minutes of the film and the amount of violence toward women is unnecessary. It would be at least reasonable if it was an allegory, but simply put, the director managed to combine misogyny, gore, and hilariously bad graphics to make a so-called thriller movie somehow casting A-list actors. After the interval, I had lost much hope for the film, and currently write this as the movie continues (I should also like to mention I created a new account for this review!). The director excuses blatant misogyny and violence in the name of some twisted 'loving' father-son relationship, and it's portrayed in an almost approving tone, exculpating the horrid main character. One star for the action scenes which keep you hooked and the first hour or so of the film and if you really want to stay positive to convince yourself that this harrowing experience was worth it, perhaps the twisted analysis you could make from the nurturing of the literally crazy MC and how he remains his own downfall makes the film a little salvageable. Regardless of anything, however, I would not label this a thriller. A psychological horror? Perhaps.",negative
9,Ranbir's performance is masterpiece. Rashmika does very natural acting.,"Anil kapoor is charismatic. Rest were best in their performances.ranbir dwells in deep in the performance. Only drawback is the duration. God performance, bobby is a stealer in 2 nd half. Because of length you will experience mild headache after moving out from theater. Ranbir turns out to be King of performance. Keeps you glued throughout movie and each reel is watchable. Screenplay and editing was good. Last few scenes could have been removed as we saw people moving out from theater at the last few mins after bobby gets killed. Some scenes could have been deleted which were just added with no relevance to the ingoing movie tempo.",positive
10,It's amazing movie must watch you will not be disappointed,"It's really a good movie , and acting skills were really good. Story is also awesome, and rashmika is fantastic in her given role ,she really carry her role superbly,where as on the other side Ranbir Kapoor and Bobby deol ohh! What a role and acting done by Bobby deol ,his comeback really made everyone think that he's such a gem actor for a reason, overall the scenes articulated by whole film actors were amazing.You need to watch this movie one time atleast and you will definitely going to enjoy this and it will be your best leisure time spending which will be worth watching this movie with your friends.",positive

The action is top notch next half is damn

5. Best Direction
I saw this movie and I was waiting for this since its announcement.Anil Kapoor is another highlight of Reddy's movie. He plays the role of Ranvijay Singh's father Balbir Singh with elan. The few scenes Tripti Dimri appears in, she lights up the screen. She has that quality as is quite evident in Bulbbul and Qala.Animal is all of its highs and goods and still entertaining. If you look at the screenplay you will be entertained you won't get bored andyou are in for 3 hours 20 minutes of entertainment. That in itself, is quite some achievement.",positive
10,Nice movie,"""Animal"" is a wild ride from start to finish! The movie combines intense drama, gripping suspense, and a stellar cast to create a cinematic experience that's truly captivating. Ranbir Kapoor's performance is raw and powerful, adding depth to his character. Anil Kapoor and Bobby Deol also shine in their respective roles, bringing a perfect blend of intensity and charisma.The storytelling is unpredictable, keeping you on the edge of your seat as the plot unfolds. The film explores the complexities of human relationships and the consequences of our choices. The dialogues are sharp, and the cinematography beautifully captures the essence of the story.The music and background score complement the narrative, enhancing the emotional impact of key scenes. The director successfully weaves together various elements, making ""Animal"" a compelling watch for those who enjoy thought-provoking cinema.However, the movie may not be for everyone, as it delves into dark and intense themes. If you're a fan of gritty storytelling and powerful performances, ""Animal"" is definitely worth a watch!",positive
10,Answer to godfather,"Animal may be bit late but is comparable to godfather not I entirety considering current age scenario. It's not as good as godfather but closest to it being different story rhan it. All those feminists and people glorifying feminisn..reviewing it negatively ..are forgetting the point.. you have to consider cinema as a picture of society..rather than criticising the mirror they should criticise the society..otherwise animal is a full entertainment film at par with Hollywood movies..I would even say Sandeep reddy as Christopher Nolan of India..the problem with indian intellectuals is to condemn to anything that is popular in current scenarios, just to be in news...rather than actual issues.",positive
10,"Cult movie ! Stylish ! Luxurious! Non comparable to Indian standards, more like oligarchs style","Movie Is a bit lengthy, but stylish , cult and amazing. Editing , and direction Superb. Ranbir kapoor n bobby deol done a fantastic job . Superb casting, superb style, n editing. Well done 🔥 Its a cool watch . For Those who adores style, attitude, power n dominance this is the movie full of thrills. All credits goes to director sandeep reddy vanga . His casting , editing and plot are super good. Normal local audience wont understand its depth. So please dont compare it with local movoes, instead compare it with hollywood cult movies. Well done and waiting for its sequel.Read a lot of negative comments but, after watching this movie i felt pity for those who compares this with indian culture . This is way above that. Movie is a fire . Watch if you can accommodate the change, the style, the power and mostly the alpha maleism.",positive
10,"Every aspect is great, but screenplay is pure genius.","1. Closed full circles and story loops.2. Ramayana/ Mahabharata inspired themes, Vanvaas, Dasharath Ji's reference, Pandava & Kaurava Ref.

Battle wounds have multidimensional consequences shown in grounded manner unlike other contemporary films, some wounds take time to heal, others need transplants and few are irreversible.5. Some scenes might seem unnecessary superficially but have great implications for future references and past happenings in Indian history along with contemporary realities. (Sw as tika and Hak en cruez)6.

The movie has a good start, a story that has a good direction, Not only does it feel generic, The songs were absolutely good. The characters are also unique and have lovely personality traits, good character. The animation was beautiful, mesmerizing and colourful. As one of the few that mixes CGI with traditional animation, it works in such a way that feels fresh and its style makes us feel like this is an actual storybook. I hope more films are made like this in the future.",positive
8,Movie justifies the Title.,"While the debut movie of the director, Arjun Reddy, was an incredibly human film, 'Animal' is a total opposite of it, so there's no point in expecting the nuance which was depicted in Arjun Reddy.'Animal' is violent, messy and no holds barred.This movie worked well when it was being a gangster-drama film showing the brutality of the main character and the villain.However it fell short when it came to exploring the relationship between spouses. The marital drama portion of the film was poorly written and executed.Hoping that the sequel, Animal Park, if made, sticks to the action-drama and build on it.",positive
9,ANiMaL: Roaring Realms of Raw Emotion and Labyrinthine Lives,"""Animal"" is a captivating Indian film that seamlessly weaves together intense drama, stellar performances, and a gripping storyline. With power-packed performances by the cast, especially Ranbir Kapoor, the film delves into complex human emotions and relationships. The engaging narrative, coupled with strong character development, keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The film's cinematography and direction contribute to its overall visual appeal. While some moments may feel intense, they add depth to the storytelling.

1,Don't waste your time,"No logic, absurd crap. Ranbir does anything and justify in the name of dads love. Rashmika wasted. Anil kapoor and Bobby Deol too. No cops in the movie, looks director forgot that cops exist in the world.waste of time, deviations from main plot several times. Watch god movies and encourage. Don't watch this crap with kids. No body will be like Ranbir in the world. Background Scott was good at times. Too much lengthy fights and not using gun for last fight was typical Indian cinema non sense logic. Wish there was some good song otherwise. Glad don't waste my time in theater. Watched in home theater and saved some bucks.",negative
7,Straight and plain,The movie is good. The action scenes are little over hyped but rest everything is good. Only minus in the film is actress/heroin Rashmika. I don't think she did a good job. She should go back to acting basics. Her presence in the movie is a big minus.The director did a fantastic job. There a few scenes in the movie which has so much detail of the directors passion towards the cinema. Ranbir's acting is phenomenal. This will another milestone in his acting career. Bobby deol is an absolute showstopper. He did an exceptional performance.Rashmika mandana is little over hyped and her performance is too bad. She should go back to acting basics. Director's choice for casting is good except for the heroin. She spoiled every scene she was in.Overall 7/10.,positive
8,Violence with great acting!,"Watched this movie on Netflix after long wait.Starting with violence - it has been shown even less than trending South Indian movies. Since it is not typical Bollywood action movies, Animal has sets the bar up and have created a master piece.Acting - Ranbeer is Gem and have done excellent work with his role and he is literally justifying the movie title. Anil Kapoor has justified his role perfectly. Last but not least... Boby Deol, he is only having around 12-15 minutes of screen time in movie. But he has made amazing impression by his charismatic acting skills.If you like South Indian films, you will definitely enjoy this violent movie.",positive
1,Tanzeel,"The animal movie disappoints with its lack of character connections, a weak plot riddled with flaws, and unnecessary fight scenes, leading to a sense of nonsensical and disconnected storytelling. Bobby Deol's character is underutilized, receiving only 15 minutes of screen time in a movie lasting over 3 hours. Rashmika's dialogue delivery is incomprehensible, leaving viewers puzzled. It's baffling how some people rated it even a 5. This movie could have been better had it directed by some genius and writer. They seem to be wasted money without making any genuine effort. Son of industrialist more sounding like a gangster. Far from reality.",negative
10,Kapoor's Unbelievable Action In ANIMAL,"Ranbir Kapoor's outstanding performance in this animal movie elevates it to new heights, making it an absolute joy to watch. With its heartwarming storyline, lovable animal characters, stunning visuals, and a strong underlying message, the film stands as a testament to Kapoor's versatility as an actor. Audiences of all ages will surely be enchanted by this delightful family film that teems with laughter, tears, and a heartfelt appreciation for the wonders of our natural world.An animal movie is often elevated by its memorable soundtrack, and this film is no exception. The evocative background score enhances the emotional impact of key moments while the foot-tapping songs provide an extra dose of entertainment. Kapoor's distinctively soulful voice adds a personal touch to the film's music, making it even more enjoyable.",positive
1,Worst Movie,"Movie should be inspirational to young generation. This movie, leave the inspiration,far away from good. I believe Movies are message to society. If you want to watch movie on father's love , ""nannuku premotho"". Without drop of blood he showed all the emotions. In this movie, you get only sex, guns and sexualizing the women. Ranbir Kapoor's worst movie. You think of any worst word and reply below. It doesn't meet any reality. In this movie they are living in society where no law and order.Nonsense 😡 movie, not one good thing about movie.I don't know how these kind of movies getting passed from censor board.",negative
1,Worst film I've watched in 2023,"There is just so much violence in this movie and it is unbearable to watch it for 3 hrs. There are so many things that are wrong in this movie, the violence, nudity, the relationship between husband and wife just being around being physical.Never watching another movie from this director. So full of male domination.Ranbir Kapoor's acting was as usual simply superb. But he could have put this effort else where.Once the second half started, I just wanted the movie to end and get out of the room.Few good comedy scenes here and there. Irrespective of the story, the cast has done a great job.",negative
3,This movie spoiled my day.,"This movie spoiled my day. There is 0% logic in this movie. This movie promote Alpha male, patriarchy concepts, unwanted violence and blood shed. Women are objectified and treated with disrespect and when this is done by the lead characters of the movie not sure, what kind of stand it's giving to the viewers. There is no reason for the 3h 30m length, it has been stretched without any story. I don't see any character difference between hero and villain in this movie. Just because hero wants save his father, he is ready to kill even innocent people(just because he is an Alpha male). Don't watch this movie and harm urselfs. Few good parts - Ranbir has acted well, BGM is good, atleast first half (1 hr) of the movie is okay. If still want to watch this movie better to see in OTT.",negative
1,"This garbage will hv negative Impact on Social Peace and Cultural Sensibilities""","It has been documented by historians that the Khafoors, who initially migrated from what is now Pakistan, adopted the surname Kapoor. This transition has been an intriguing aspect of their family history, but recent cinematic endeavors by the Kapoor lineage have sparked a different kind of curiosity.The Kapoor family claims that they have established themselves as a powerhouse in the Indian film industry. However, recent movies have raised eyebrows, prompting reflection on the content they choose to portray on screen, including hurting the sentiments of millions by claiming that BEEF is their favorite dish.Some critics argue that their recent works delve into topics that are deemed unworthy of discussion. The concern voiced here goes beyond artistic differences; it delves into the realm of cultural insensitivity and the blatant targeting of religious sentiments.It is disheartening to witness the Kapoor seemingly endorsing content that are deem as ""pure garbage."" From Raj Kapoor films consistently aim to undermine cultural values and religious sentiments raises questions about the efficacy of the censorship or assessment bodies responsible for granting approval to such content for public viewing.One cannot ignore the dissatisfaction expressed by some viewers who feel that the Kapoor family, in their cinematic pursuits, appears eager to introduce themes associated with brothel culture - a choice that adds an uncomfortable layer to their legacy. It seems they admire harem culture.Personally, my attempt to engage with the latest Kapoor film was cut short at the 11-minute mark. The trajectory of the narrative became apparent, and it left me questioning the standards upheld by the clearing and assessing bodies responsible for granting it a green light for general public consumption.This critical examination is not an attack on artistic freedom but a call for responsible filmmaking that respects the diverse fabric of Indian society. As audiences, we must remain vigilant and vocal about our expectations from the cinematic world, urging creators to contribute positively to the cultural discourse rather than perpetuating controversy for the sake of it.",negative
9,Totally rush and unforgettable experience,"For me it worked coz it not about to change the society & its never a story of hero, fake feminists are crying about it you can't show hero like this, but it's always about the dark truth everyone have evil side which is shown in cinema and people loved it watching, for me cinema never for representing one sided nature of human it meant to be show both side of human, unless you avoid the truth your,then i accept your criticism is fair and you tryna to keep unknown from truth.More of this i personally like the lord Bobby, man got potential just waiting a chance to prove it and got chance in animal and shows it in movie, even it without a dialouge, i remember audience got crazy on lord entry.More now,
Looking forward for animal park....",positive
8,Mashrafi Antu's Review!,"Animal (2023), directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, is a Bollywood action-crime thriller that has divided critics and audiences.Here's a breakdown of the main points:Positives:
Visually Stunning: The film is praised for its beautiful cinematography and stylish action sequences.

Excessive Length: The film's runtime of 3 hours and 22 minutes is considered by many to be excessive, dragging the story and testing the audience's patience.Morally Bankrupt and Violent: Critics find the film's celebration of violence and misogyny to be problematic and unnecessary.Lack of Character Development: Some find the characters to be underdeveloped and unrelatable, making it difficult to connect with them on an emotional level.Confusing Plot: The film's complex plot and ambiguous ending leave some viewers feeling confused and dissatisfied.Overall:
Animal is a visually impressive and action-packed film, but its flaws, particularly its excessive length and problematic content, cannot be ignored. It's a film that will likely appeal to fans of Bollywood action films and Ranbir Kapoor's performances, but may leave others disappointed.",positive

I don't understand why so many people are hating and giving it such a low rating, this deserves way more than a 6.5 - defo higher than an 8 star rating for me. I can't wait to see what part 2, Animal Park brings us when it comes out!! Loved the movie and would definitely be watching it again even though it is a 3.5 hour movie!

4,"Blood, Gore Action and more ACTION!!","Review of ""Animal"" by CD:It appears either I've taken a detour into madness or the entire Indian cinema audience has gone on a collective frenzy!Just as I detested Gadar 2 and Jawan, both becoming box office hits, now comes Animal - a movie that further puts action to an entirely new level, portraying a world where the city or even the entire country lacking law and order. It portrays a world, where people can freely engage in acts of violence without consequence.The story revolves around an obsessive son, played by Ranbir Kapoor, who unleashes his inner one-man army to avenge any harm befalling his father. While Ranbir's performance shines, the movie itself dips into a mad display of relentless action, seemingly absent of any storyline.Surprisingly, these movies seem to be working with the Indian audience, coz Animal also seems to be successful in the opening week.Personally, I rate it a 4/10, largely attributed to Ranbir's commendable performance. However, beyond that, it's a prolonged 3½ hour movie, that is best avoided.",negative
1,Outrage and Disappointment,"It's disappointing to encounter movies that evoke such strong negative emotions. Prominent figures, particularly in countries where cinema wields considerable influence, should indeed consider their social responsibilities. Films lacking substance and portraying disrespectful treatment, especially towards women, offer no space for creative appreciation. Titling a movie ""Animal"" doesn't excuse or validate the excessive display of misogyny, elitism, and narcissism. There's a fine line that should never be crossed in film, yet unfortunately, this movie surpassed it long before intermission, making the viewing experience an enduring frustration.",negative
8,Thought provoking yet lacking substance,"""Animal"", directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, stands as a captivating cinematic experience that traverses the intricate web of human emotions, choices and consequences. This film isn't merely about its title; it's an innate exploration of the animalistic instincts residing within every human. Vanga's storytelling skills are evident from the film's onset, crafting a narrative that's not afraid to confront the complexities of morality, ethics, power dynamics and the relentless pursuit of justice. The prominent portrayal of a unhinged son whose childhood was isolated as his father never valued and shared enough time with him thereby lacking attention from a father figure leading to feelings of abandonment, insecurity, or frustration.What really sets Animal apart is its ability to create multifaceted characters that exist in morally gray areas where ethical boundaries are unclear and ambiguous where defining morally correct course of action becomes challenging due to conflicting moral principles and subjective interpretations to what is considered as morally accepted.The film's strength lies not just in it's narrative but the phenomenal cast and their performance. The entire project did a wonderful job initiating with the stunning cinematography and the emotionally striking soundtrack by Vishal Mishra that elevates the film's impact.The film has faced various allegations of misogyny due to interpretations of its portrayal of female characters. Critics and audiences have highlighted concerns about the way women are treated throughout the story, citing instances where women are objectified and subjected to violence that i feel is inutile, However the director and the creators of the film may have their own artistic intention for presenting it so, it's important to consider these viewpoints while acknowledging the various opinions and discussions about the film's portrayal of women.Animal does not acknowledge or express regret in its course of human psyche and behaviour, challenging viewers to question their own beliefs about justice, revenge and the blurred boundaries between the good and evil. It's a cinematic experience that hovers in the mind, leaving a thought provoking impression that extends beyond the confines of the screen.",positive
1,Worst movie!,"This movie only contain faul language, nudity and psyco behavior of thr people(s). This type of movie shuld passed by movie board. As a student I am sure that this type of movie will effect the young generation to do bad things in future. In the place of these movie we (the young generation) need the visual things that will help in creating better future because one the young generation will become the future of our country. I hope at least 1% people think what I mentioned.What we see our subconscious mind catches and try to evaluate that without our permission.So the films should be like that suits the young generation.",negative
7,Trailer's Hype and Real movie is completely opposite.,1- The bond of father & son which was the whole attraction in trailer was not at all shown in movie.2- Bobby's character was hardly for 10 mins. The same we saw in trailer that's it.3- Alot of unrealistic scenes but lets ignore this. Bcz alot of blockbuster movie could get criticised.4- Anil Sir's character was just confused. He is busy with work but doesn't have any idea of his business insides too.5- Mandana's character was ok ok type. Faltu bold romance.6- Its all about Ranbir and his acting is also cool.Conclusion- You will feel Rocky bhai is in city with blend of Kabir Singh. Also if you watched the trailer you watched the whole movie's main scenes.,positive
1,Need a vacation to recover from this 'movie',"Even after trying for hours, I haven't been able to think of a worse movie that I have seen or even heard of. This beats even the various mindless 'blockbusters' of Bollywood in absurdity in every category, including incoherent dialogue, story, screenplay, misogyny and general toxicity, amongst other things.There is an abundance of force fitted sexual innuendos (so pathetic that made me reminisce about poor jokes one would enjoy as a 12 year old) and mind numbing violence with no relation to the 'movie' at all; leading you to need time and another form of entertainment and possibly a whole other weekend to recover from this traumatic experience of enduring this 'movie'.Please do yourselves a favour and avoid this.",negative
8,"Animal: A Story About Toughness, Interesting Characters, and Awesome Music""","""Animal"" is a cool movie that talks about being tough and has some interesting characters and great music. The story is all about what it means to be tough, and it looks at how being too tough can cause problems.The characters in the movie are really intense, going through a lot to show what toughness is all about. The story gets more and more interesting as we see how these characters deal with being tough.What makes ""Animal"" even better is the awesome music. The beats and melodies in the movie make every part more exciting. The music is like another character, making the whole experience way more fun.The way the movie looks and how it's directed also make it stand out. The scenes capture the strong emotions of the characters. Ranbir Kapoor did a fantastic job, making ""Animal"" a really impressive film.In the end, ""Animal"" is not just a movie - it's an exploration of toughness, a story that keeps you hooked, and a movie with amazing music that you'll remember even after it's over. It's a bold take on what it means to be tough, and it's a movie you won't forget.",positive
1,Wanted to give negative rating..worst movie ever,"An advice - You'll thank laterDon't waste your money, time, energy or anything in watching Animal.Sandeep Vanga have some high testosterone fantasies, with added dopamine he created a violent (& illogical) video game into a movie.Other than RanbirKapoor brilliance - It's an headache! Such movies & movie makers should be banned from movie making.Don't even try to even find any sort of logic in this movie, because there is none. Long back Aamir Khan said - Directors who can't tell their stories creatively, they sell it with action & sex.One thing is for sure, I will never watch a Sandeep Vanga movie again. Had Ranbir Kapoor not acted in it, no one would have even bothered watching it till end.Worst movie we ever watched in a theatre.",negative
10,An Epic,"Animal is an epic of a movie. A movie that cannot even be produced by Hollywood. A history in making. The rage, the glory is all at an another level. Even the lengthy running time period of the movie seems trivial to witness it on screen. For sure they could have cut some scenes to keep it even more sharp, but the performance of the protagonist overpowers the small shortcomings. A MUST WATCH. FULL 10/10.PS - This was my first Indian movie I saw in Toronto, Canada after being here all my life, and I created an IMDB account to ensure from my part, that this movie gets, what it deserves. - Adam.",positive
10,ANIMAL IS A PATHBREAKING ACTION FILM,"I totally I loved the film and the performances by Ranbir Kapoor,Anil Kapoor,Bobby Deol,and other cast of the film, Sandeep Reddy Wanga Sir Kept his promise and showed as a proper violent film with lots of blood shed and huge action scenes in the first half of the film. This movie is about three and an half hours long but still didn't even feel slow at any point of the movie. Few scenes in the film may disappoint but the overall impact and the post credit scene will raise the expectations for the ANIMAL PARK (sequel) of the film.According to me it is a must watch film a rise of new cinema!!!!",positive
10,One of best watch,"Move is one of best watch. Had a good time watching it. Worth time, money. The efforts, acting and production did an amazing job. Anil Kapoor, Ranbir kapoor and Boby Deol were just fabulous.One of a kind movie after a long time. Glad to see more filamtic movies coming this way. The scenes the fights the romance were binding.Songs are good !! The love and hatred are potrayed at next level. Indian cinenmas generally don't come up with this kind of movies easily.It actually brings your inner animal out. If you are looking for a good watch over weekend, this could be a perfect entertainment pack.",positive
10,New era of Bollywood has begun,"Forget the haters. This is a masterpiece. Never before seen something like this in Indian cinema.Ranbir has nailed the character completely. I can proudly say he's acting in this movie is God level what a vision from director Sandeep Reddy vangaArjan Vailly Ne O Paer Jodke Gandassi Mari this is the true meaning of Ranbir in this movie.The story line is new and director has taken everything from normal to extreme.Anil Kapoor also supported well in his role.Bobby deol is a killer. Less screen time but he delivered fully
Rashmika looks good.Some people say this is a pathetic movie. But just watch this you will not regret it. Full Paisa wasool movie.",positive
9,Best of 2023 also the wildest movie ever made in Bollywood.,"I'm a very big fan of Ranbir Kapoor. I've been watching him since my childhood from Barfi, Rockstar , Sawariya to Tamasha, Brahmastra and finally Animal. As I've mentioned Animal is the wildest movie ever made by Bollywood there are few point that made me feel like this. If I talk about the story and screenplay Samdeep Reddy Vanga just nailed it. His previous kabir Singh got massive hitt! When I got know that he'll make a movie with Ranbir Kapoor I just get shocked. Animal movie is for those who loves something violence and drama. So many Kapoors have been there. I don't want say much things about these. This is the first time I'm bringing a review right here. Thank you. <3.",positive
9,New era of Bollywood,"Like any other films it has it's own flaws, but I would say the director did a great job. Action and music was mind-blowing. And Acting of Ranbir Kapoor was next level. Full on Entertainment. Not all movie have to have a nice massage or vision, some just needs to be done for the entertainment purposes. Bollywood's approach to violence movie was done right. With brilliant BGM, Action And ranbir kapoor's amazing acting skills that Adranline rush just amazing the story was also going nice. Bobby Deol took the limelight with his screen presence. Rashmika Mandanna and Anil kapoor did a nice job with their characters.",positive
8,Best of today's Bollywood industry movies,"Here is my attempt to write a movie review for Animal in 610 characters:Animal is a gripping and intense action thriller that explores the dark and twisted relationship between a father and a son. Ranbir Kapoor delivers a stellar performance as Ranvijay Singh, a ruthless and violent gangster who is obsessed with his father Balbir Singh, played by Anil Kapoor. The film is directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, who is known for his bold and raw storytelling. The film has a runtime of 201 minutes¹, but it never feels dull or dragged. The film is full of twists and turns, and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The film also features Bobby Deol, Rashmika Mandanna and Tripti Dimri in supporting roles, who add to the drama and emotion of the film. Animal is a must-watch for fans of action and crime genres, and for those who appreciate powerful and realistic cinema.",positive
10,Father Son Love,"Father Son Love and relationship is same as in most of the family. Even it had 18+ scene and more violence, it is must watch movies especially for Father of a son.Relationship and feelings conveyed by this movie changed my perspective.I am waiting for the 2nd part, Animal Park.It is not a movie, It is a emotion. It helped to solve my family problems in my life.I promise you that it will be a good story. It is like modern Mahabharatam. Movie is full of family problems. It is related to family problem linked to past generation.BG music and songs was awesome especially in fight scene. The story was awesome. But some scene did not had logic(such as alpha male and talk about sex with other girl).THANK YOU.",positive
10,Masterpiece,"Best ever created movie to show an extreme level of love after kabir singh. Masterpiece created by Sandeep Reddy Vanga.Hats off to your perception and thinking of how to create the best screenplay. Everything was perfect and balanced.Most people are into soft romantic movies of bollywood played by famous hero's. Seeing the soft side of love and world, but in reality we have this level of love and hate as well. Only people who love others to their extreme and reach this kind level can understand. Not everyone can understand this.Good work sir keep it up.Waiting for your next production.",positive
1,I felt bad for myself after watching this movie,"This movie is hands down the worst Bollywood movie I've watched(not exaggerating at all).'Animal' was pathetic on so many levels. Leave alone the toxic masculinity, misogyny and violence shown in the movie, the movie was so boring and couldn't keep me engaged. There was not a single scene in the movie which kept me hooked up for it.No consistency, no plot, unrealistic and an absolute failure.The length of the movie could have been shorter. There were comic scenes introduced in the movie which had nothing to do with the script(if there was any). The comic scenes were really poor, personally.Ranbir Kapoor's acting was excellent undoubtedly, along with Bobby deol and Anil Kapoor. Rashmika Mandana was just playing a side role and she was very insignificant in the movie so we won't be talking about her.Apart from them no actor had any mind blowing screentime.",negative
5,How Would I Unseen it.,Watched the movie with losts of expectations but its a very big let down. Now my respect for Kabir Singh increased many fold. Waisted Bobby Deol's presence in the Star Cast. Songs are really good. BGM score is Ok. Anil Kapoor and other startcast did nothing as only Ranbir Kapoor is the only one who got the maximum screentime. He did his best but story is very weak. Director is on mission to make a violent movie and he did it without being bothered about story line and other critical movies requirment. The new girl is there in movie for intimate scenes only and Rashmika did a horrible job. Her only job is to hit Ranbir.,negative
1,"Waste of Time, waste of money, No story only violence","Funny part was there is no police overall movie. Its just animal world where he kills whoever he wants. He will have sex whenever he wants. Senseless, Storyless , emotion less. Only sex and violence. Very irritating to see blood all the time. Seems like Advanced form of Arjun Reddy.it gives very negative impact on the latest generation. There is no good performances by actors. I felt Archies is far better than Animal. Even animals behave properly than Ranbir character. If we are frustrated and want to see blood and violence then animal is the best option. It's very upsetting from Ranbir doing such characters.",negative
10,Wonderful story and screenplay must watch 100 percent movie,"Now, let's dive into what truly makes ""Animal"" a cinematic triumph. The ensemble cast delivers a performance of the highest caliber, with each actor bringing their A-game to the table. Ranbir Kapoor's portrayal is nothing short of exceptional; he not only meets but exceeds expectations. His ability to immerse himself in the character adds an extra layer of authenticity to the film.The emotional rollercoaster reaches its peak in the last scene, leaving the audience teary-eyed and deeply moved. It's a testament to the director Sandeep Reddy Vanga's mastery in storytelling and emotional resonance. Bobby Deol, too, shines brightly with his impeccable acting, proving yet again that he is a force to be reckoned with in the industry.",positive
8,"Amazing film, but definitely not for the feminists and weak hearted","The movie was just outstanding and heart throbbing, since the start. Especially the BGM., there is no other movie that displays such emotions through the BGM, it was spot on.Moving towards the acting, there is no doubt that Ranbir Kapoor has put his all. Every scene is just fantastic, the emotions and expressions conveyed made you feel like you were witnessing a complete animal that did anything and everything for its families survival. As of Ranbir's character many say that his character is surrounded by abuse and masculinity that tries to triumph over others. That is somewhat true and without this quality in his character the movie would not be what it came out as. It would have been closer to any other action packed Bollywood film, where the films protagonist also cares about social morals and norms while achieving his own objectives. Ranbir's character happens to be that he only trusts his family members, and anyone that stands opposing him weather be his own wife, he doesn't care as family is everything to him. Him defying this norms and morals is what makes his character good and lovely as he can surpass anything and anyone for what he thinks is right, thus becoming an Animal.The action scenes in the film were amazing and unpredictable, while including the Bollywood touch. Also, the timing of the song Arjun Vailly was impeccable. The song fit the action sequences perfectly and had many intresting and different styles of violence for those that enjoy action and more importantly a violent film. This is probably the first violent film in Bollywood that actually has good action.Lastly the story, the story was really simple and made sense, throughout. That being a son trying to obtain the love from his father and ensures the safety for his family. The only thing negative about the film was that it was long and could have been shortened down to a much better length. As some scenes were dragged up. But for those that enjoy longer scenes with emotions and action it was really well down and scripted.Overall the film deserves to be ranked really well. The films timing of the songs and BGM were perfect and couldn't have a better timing, the acting was spot on, the scene, direction, and dialogue were well written and scripted, and the story made sense and was exciting and engaging. The film did have some downplay but even with them, the film in the end kept me engaged, entertained and now makes me eagerly wait for the second part!!!!",positive
10,Awesome,"After watching this movie people will be in trans for nearly 3 to 4 hours.All characters given importance and prominent role.All has fullfill this 100 percent. Mainly main stream cast is good and did well. As a father Anil Kapoor made a classic apperance. Same with mother role.Coming to national crush rashmika mandana did a challenging and equal to ranbeer Kapoor is extraordinary. She performed sportive and challenging to ranabir. And coming to director he made a pure raw film with guts and showed new trade mark to Bollywood Sandeep Reddy vanga great job.Man of the movie our
Ranbeer rocks.",positive
1,not a good movie at all,I am a big fan of ranbir and rashmika . As they always have had one of the best movies. As always I thought it would be great movie but my expectation was wrong. The film do not have a good storyline nor good characters. It is a complete version of violence and violence nothing else. It can misdirect the youth. I do not know why did ranbir and rashmika sign such kind of movie as there all the movies were amazing. Where films used to give some motive. And we used to get to learn from the movies but this do not what is about movie or what is it telling. Just getting upset as all my expectation were wrong.,negative
10,Bollywood at its peak,"The movie begins on a higher note with all the action, intrigue, drama, differences, etc..... the chemistry between rashmika mandhana and Ranbir Kapoor seemed a bit off, the highest point of the first half were 1. Where Ranbir goes back to his old family members for support and they all agree to help him 2. UPENDRA LIMAYE a seasoned MAHARASHTRIAN veteran giving the absolute dopamine of this movie with his very deep voice and on point dialogue delivery .........nailed it.The second half seems to be presented by a different set of writers, directors etc........It was the complete opposite of first half except for LORD BOBBY'S Introduction (This has to be the most amazing, subtle, stunning entry for a Bollywood negative role, with that Jamal Jamaalo Iranian song being cherry on top for that fantastic entry) Bobby single handedly carries the second half saving the movie from average story & direction.To sum it up, I would give this movie a solid 8 and definitely recommend to watch it on cinemas.Bollywood at its peak!!!!!!!",positive
10,Goosebumps,Ranbir Singh and the BGMs 10/10. I would give 10 star for the movie just based on the first half of the movie. The second half lags due to some unncessary and elongated sex conversations but the money is worth for even just first half. The timing of the BGMs and Ranbir Kapoor's acting is just superb. It was just goosebumps. I have already watched the movie three times and every time the excitment level was same even already knowing the next move and every dialogue. I would definitely be watching it again on Netflix if not in theatre for thr fourth time. The last scene between Ranbir and Anil Kapoor is just so intense and emotional. 10/10 from me. Eagerly waiting for Animal Park.,positive
7,Unbelievable,"Sometimes a good movie, but at the same time, way too vulgar. The length of time is also unbelievably long. The amounts of times that I've had to close my eyes to keep my well being and sanity. It had some funny parts, but at the same time, I couldn't wait for when it was over. I highly love Ranbir and Sunny, but I can easily tell that this was easily there worst movie to see. I was highly disappointed to see how the movie turned out. It had a good story line, but it was so hard to track, and to really see what was going on.Characters had good stories, yet the he things they did during the duration of the movie was unbearable to see.",positive
10,Characterisation and emotions were spot on,"0 dilution in the protagonist's character
Every frame has been elevated with wonderful music and BGM
No words. It's a life time experience movie.Directional qualities are phenomenal
Even heroine's character arc is excellent
Hats off to Vanga for pulling off such an intense emotions from each and every artist
Bobby deol's expression would be a special mention
Climax shots were absolutely bang on
Protagonist's love towards his family has been portrayed so very well and that would be the intensity every individual would love to show but due societal constraints, we might not express the same. Here, in the movie Vanga has achieved that beauty.",positive
10,Chat gpt,"The animal-themed movie starring Ranbir Kapoor, Anil Kapoor, Bobby Deol, and Rashmika Mandanna offers a delightful blend of humor and heart. Ranbir Kapoor's charismatic performance adds charm, while Anil Kapoor's veteran presence brings depth to the narrative. Bobby Deol's portrayal adds a touch of humor, and Rashmika Mandanna brings a refreshing energy. The film's engaging storyline, coupled with impressive CGI for the animal characters, creates an immersive cinematic experience. The ensemble cast's chemistry and the film's well-paced plot make it an enjoyable watch for audiences of all ages.",positive
8,Superb Performance!,"Acting 10/10... No one can argue that...If you go with expectation of blood shed and don't use logic (like what's law & order situation), you'll will be in awe by performances put in by each character.Its a very different movie for Hindi cinema and certainly hard to digest for a section of viewers. But there is also a section of viewers who appreciate the portrayal of complex relationships between father/son, husband/wife... Ranbir is going to be a big contender for all big awards next year for his superb performance. Just because he dominated the movie doesn't mean performance of Anil Kappor and Rashmika Mandana shouldn't be noticed.Great job by all star cast !",positive
8,Spectacular,"All the people giving this movie 1 star should be having amazing stories with them. Why don't they all go ahead and make some spectacular movies?? People are forgetting it's just a movie, just 3 hours and not their life, just move on. I feel pity for all those crying and giving negative reviews. I totally enjoyed the movie. It's a come back from Ranbir, and has bypassed so many recent films in box office collection. It seems so many people are prejudiced against this movie because of the negative online reviews but it's actually helping the movie with getting tremendous success. In love with the music and performances from Ranbir, Anil and Bobby. A complete entertainer.",positive
9,Something different from Bollywood,"The acting was epic by Ranbir.I wasn't a fan before this movie.Story was good, great cast and suited roles.Bobby's entry was legendary, shorty screen time but will be the most memorable of his career. Comedy action and romance, romance was a little too much and not needed.They have to try and balance powerful movies to accommodate family views.I'd loved to have watched this movie with my son but I didn't because of the sex scenes.Bollywood doesn't need that.However overall it was a great movie. I've stopped watching Bollywood as much as I used too, but if they keep movies like this coming is id defo increase my watching time.",positive
8,Kabir Singh On Steroids!,"This movie is great for those who love action and family drama. The action sequences could've been choreographed a little better but overall it's a great and VIOLENT! Although it did not reach my expectations but it was still a hell of a ride. Ranbir's acting was just top tier and every supporting cast did their job well. Only downside was Bobby's character. I feel like he deserved more screen time and a better presentation but every time he came on the screen, he was an absolute beast. Don't miss this movie in the theaters, it's worth every penny. Don't bring your children to the theaters!!!!",positive
8,Movie to watch for once.,"Good movie to watch for once. Though the movie has many blanks to cover ups. However, could be watched for entertainment. Fight sequel, songs and certains scenes are really good. Performance by the lead actor is seriously something to appreciate, I mean actor showed the diversity.The movie could not be an entertaining one for the aged crowd, but could prove healthy for the new generation.Recommendation: Movie could be watched at once with family and group.* However, if possible one is seriously recommended to wait for the movie to get launched on the OTT platforms or to be telecasted over national channel.",positive
7,Alpha Male with ISIS violence,"Ranbir Kapoor is the backbone of the movie. Can't see any other character and you dont even need to.You will bear it for 3:12 hours, dont worry.Open conversations like couple and family drama feels naturalDragged a bit but Ranbir Kapoor covers the part and you love watching him.Bobby's character is okay, could have been better.Action scenes are like leaked ISIS videos.Good movie, never seen anylike like this is bollywood. Once you watch it and digest it, you will remember the scenes and will relive them.Interval is better than climax and is veryy violent and you cover your ticket till interval. After that you are watching a bonus.",positive

10,Need more movies like this,"Guys, don't believe the low ratings and bad reviews on the internet. I'm sure those are mostly from women. No woman will ever like this movie due to the level of misogyny shown in it. This movie is not for everyone, but if you liked Kabir Singh, then you will find it much more classy and massier.As for the guys, you will absolutely love this movie just like I did. The violence, rage, madness, blood & gore are all on par with Hollywood. Sandeep Reddy Vanga really showed us how actions movies are made. Just go and watch it, you will feel like you are watching yourself on the screen.Eagerly waiting for 'Animal Park'",positive

But when you talk about a father it's Very less because people don't speak about father Mo. They always respect him from his heart and bottom of his heart when I saw this movie, I felt it was my love to my own father, if anything comes wrong to my father, I would react the same way the movie astronaut. I really respect and happy to see. A movie happy to see a movie which was made on a father. We have seen many movies related to mother. And also dedicated especially to mother.",positive
10,Go n watch the film!!!!,"""Animal"" stands as the epitome of my cinematic journey. Ranbir Kapoor's performance is a tour de force, eclipsing all previous roles. The movie's fusion of action and gore competes head-to-head with Hollywood's best, setting a new benchmark. Despite accusations of misogyny, it's crucial to appreciate it as pure entertainment, steering clear of societal judgment. In a genre shared by series like ""Sacred Games"" and ""Mirzapur,"" ""Animal"" distinguishes itself, demanding attention as a cinematic marvel. It's an immersive experience that truly comes alive in the theater- a must-watch that defies expectations and leaves an indelible mark.",positive
1,Where is the story?,"No story, no sense but only violence. Good for those who only like to see blood and baseless reasons of killing. The movie may do good but to any sensible person, it will prove to be garbage. Does Bollywood not have any good stories anymore? I wonder if the actors worked for the story or money alone. The movie seems like a creature that doesn't exist - Elephant head, Giraffe neck, Tiger strips and Dogs tail. Don't understand the psychology of those praising the movie or character because they both are highly toxic. Woukd recommend ""Powerpuff Girls"" rather.I am still in trauma after watching this, hope my sanity returns soon.",negative
10,Super duper blockbuster,"Top performances, top direction, action, dialogues, everything. For bollywood lovers. Ranbir Kapoor has arrived, s superstar. Waiting for the next part desperately. It was s thrilling roller coaster ride. The background score is also amazing with that punjabi touch. All bollywood masala packed in one movie. Watch it with no judgments, for entertainment. It's a new gen movie for the thrill lovers. Amazing and a very differently led story and wonderfully expressed. The styling of characters is also amazing. Ranbir looking awsome in every look. Bobby deol too. Must watch. Don't miss and regret. Go!",positive
6,Good to go.,"Not bad, not good, just good to go. After watching the promising trailer I gave Bollywood another chance, but the movie didn't reach expectations.Bobby deol and Ranbeer Singh carried the movie but at some point you'll feel the movie was dragged.If they cut out the forced humour, unnecessary romance and of-course the songs, the movie could be better.Having a basic, straight forward plot, 3.5 hours is way too much for this movie.It's still better than most recent Bollywood, it's a move in the right direction but it's far away from being close to a ""great"" film.6 would be the most fair rating for this movie.",negative

Directed by the talented Sandeep Reddy Vanga, the film not only showcases Kapoor's acting prowess but also pushes the envelope of Indian cinema.The narrative of ""Animal"" is a gripping exploration of complex human relationships, layered with suspense, emotion, and unexpected twists. Kapoor's portrayal of his character is nothing short of exceptional, capturing the essence of a man navigating the intricate web of family dynamics and personal dilemmas.

As in absolutely there were no need for that.Mindless violence through out the movie - as in first violent scenes were shot then they tried to stitch together to create a non existent story may be.The above points are just about the art of movie creation which was showcased in the worse possible manner.I am not even highlighting the social message it conveys in terms of ""misogyny"" and ""smoking is cool"".Anyways, I am a culprit for adding some numbers to this movie's collection. But I realised I would be even a bigger culprit, if I don't speak out, even though I don't review movie much.",negative
10,Best Animal of Bollywood,"Animal goes to the next level compared with Kabir Singh by SRV and yes this action packed thriller has at some moment extreme violence or bloodshed shown on screen but that goes with flow of character played by RK and well supported by storyline, editing and directing by SRV. Best part of watching this in IMAX theater is its background score which is embedded in each frame and action sequence. Soulful songs with fantastic music go very well with storyline moving forward in fast paced sequence. First half is just mind blowing with second half going deeper and revealing every character in a nuanced way.",positive
10,Animal helped me fighting Cancer!,It was a testosterone boosting movie for me. Fighting with cancer and this helped me in my treatment how to keep confidence in yourself and how to take treatments. It helped me mentally and made me stronger with all the action and story! I am having my Bone Marrow Transplant in coming days and will watch this again while having my chemos and BMT. This came at the right time.The movie was spot on with story Ranbir was amazing throughout the RanVinay character was something all men want to be. Our papas are our heroes and we always want to give them back in whatever way we can! Amazingly exceptional!,positive
8,Don't miss the post credit scene,"Entertained throughout the 3 hours duration time, Ranbir kapoor nailed every scene, in some scenes he reminded me of Rauf lala (played by Late Mr. Rishi kapoor) He just reminded everyone why he is considered the best actor of this generation. Powerful fight sequence with songs playing in the background was a masterpiece by Sandeep Reddy vanga. Don't pay any attention to the critics, they can't digest the audacity of Sandeep Reddy vanga, putting in simple words. Highly recommended if you like movies like kill bill, john vick and please don't miss the credit scenes, it's crazy. Bobby Deol with a short role gave a massive performance. Loved other cast members as well.",positive

8,Future of Bollywood- Alpha Male + Southern stars reach,"Raw, Wild, 10/10 based on casting and acting wise.This is a movie which happened to Bollywood before its time.Alpha Male is actually the Director of the movie, he brought together Bollywood favorite Ranbir, All time favorite Anil Kapoor, South India's favorite Rashmika, addition of Sikh family and then villain from particular religion. This is almost bringing whole of India together.A perfect storyline between a rich Father and time seeking son. A son crossing all limits to keep his father alive and then not getting enough appreciation in return.First half is probably the cult classic, which includes love, action, drama, weapons, family will stay with viewers for long time. Second half does get bit slow for a while where connection building of incidence in 1st half actually takes place, but then introduction of Bobby Deol adds the perfectly made climax and even then more of the future predictions which come along.This movie is definitely going to set new standards for the Bollywood. Ranbir stands in different league now.",positive

At least they have shown something untold.The conclusion is the guidance of the father and mother is the most important in this world.Communication gap and love which is not expressed by his father can change the human to animal.At least we need to rate at least 8.

Ranbir Kapoor's performance was on exceptional levels. However, as a female viewer I would emphasize that the plot twist where the Ranbir's infidelity impacts the film's rating. Though the movie's exploration of a father-son relationship might resonate well with male audiences, perhaps the cheating element might be a red flag for some female viewers. Therefore, leading to a final rating of 7.5 out of 10. Without the infidelity subplot, it could have achieved a perfect score of 10.",positive
9,Backward Indian Audience will deeply suffer,"I am not overwhelmed by the positive responses as I certainly understand the depth of their understanding, they are appreciating it for mostly wrong reasons. I am not shocked by the brutally negative reviews it is facing because I understand the breadth of knowledge and experience for those people which is compelling them to say ten bad things. This movie can be simply categorised as distinctively iconoclastic and unapologetically bold. People who live within a bubble can't even interpret the emotional dynamics between the characters and psychological nuances the protagonists reflect. Satyajit Ray truly categorised Indian audience as a fairly backward one. Backward here means culturally backward that comes from the type of books people read or the type of movie people watch or the type of music people listen. I can remember the scene from the movie Raging Bull where Jack Lamotta punched her wife and brutally insulted his dear brother (accused him having sex with his sister in law). How one should interpret that scene? Is it simply a violent man hitting the weaker sex and showing physical dominance in a man's world? In order to absorb that visual and comment over it, you need a deep study that will remove your monolithic, biased attitude. The funniest feedback that I am hearing amomg this series of criticism is it might influence the audience and they might start exercising all the wrongdoing. Sadly none of them would have understood the inner meaning of the story depicted in the inaugural scene. Such criticism, much wow! The way conventional Indian cinema (all of the India) has murdered the soul of it's audience for last 100 years, the soul cleansing process needs sharp fences like this.",positive

9,Movie made to be watched in Theatre!,"ANIMAL is a movie to be experienced in THEATRE. Bgm is lit, actions scenes are exceptional (I got the vibe of korean action movies; handcombats and gun shots), so many scenes that you goosebumps, drama is there, family scenes, adult contents and Father-Son bridge.Certain scenes are political too if you think like the character of Ranbir.Music is like a cherry on top and is used in a story telling way.I loved the youthful phase of Ranvijay Singh Balbir and I wished it was prolonged a bit.First half is one of the best, if not the best in whole Indian Movie history. Movie turns it page to Drama, Monologue and Consequences, hence the comparison to first half makes second half a bit slow. BUT this is where the leading man is needed, and RANBIR KAPOOR is the leading man, ask no more, just give the guy screen time and he takes audiences all the way to point where BOBBY DEOL comes up.Acting reveiws:Ranbir's career best. And another reason why 3 hours and 23 min doesn't feel long. Guy is a master in his craft. He is injested as the leading man. Ranbir is another reason why second half's monologue will be good (or else any other actors would find it challenging).Bobby's screen presence is limited but you will feel why the noise. Your rising tempo will be erupted once he appears. Fight scenes are incredibly shot. He breathes in his character. The moment he appears, you will believe his rage and plans. Bobby is back with a bang.Rashmika has done a beautiful job, especially in the second half. Dialouges could have been a bit clear. But she expresses what her character is going through. Totally justified.Tripti Dimri is beautiful and impactful at the same time. Her dialouge delivery is so clean. A step up and a big character presence when she appears. You will be seeing her around a lot.Anil kapoor is full of experiences and his presence has been justified by Vanga's direction. Few scenes where his craft has peaked.Other cast, shakti kapoor, saurabh sachdeva, suresh oberoi, Freddy guy, Prithviraj all are amazing. Handpicked casts assembled.Conclusion:
Overall, its an experience of action, rage, family rifts and music.I thoroughly enjoyed ANIMAL. Few scenes with the intensity of FIRST half if added in SECOND half, could have only bettered the experience.Vanga is a genius. Nothing but respect to him for spilling out the stories he wanted to tell.Its a WELL-MADE movie with well chosen star casts.AND an advice to audience,
Stay till the end. Just when you thought Ranbir is a genius, he will make you look for better adjectives than 'genius'.",positive
7,Animal: A Riveting Tale of Male Fantasy and Unbridled Action,"Animal is a film that lives up to its name. It is a wild, thrilling ride that is sure to leave you breathless. The first half of the film is particularly impressive, thanks to a powerful performance by Upendra Limaye. Limaye steals the show with his intense portrayal of a man on the edge. The second half of the film is equally captivating, but in a different way. Bobby Deol delivers a nuanced performance that will stay with you long after the credits roll.A Male-Centric NarrativeAnimal is undeniably a film that caters to the male fantasy. It is a story about male dominance and power. The film is not shy about its masculinity, and this may not appeal to all viewers. However, for those who enjoy films that celebrate the male spirit, Animal is sure to please.High Points of the First HalfThe first half of Animal is full of high-octane action and suspense. Ranbir Kapoor delivers a career-defining performance as the film's protagonist. Kapoor is believable and captivating in the role, and he carries the film on his shoulders. The action sequences in the first half are some of the best in recent memory. They are well-choreographed and exciting, and they will keep you on the edge of your seat.Second Half: Bobby Deol's Hour to ShineThe second half of Animal takes a different turn. The focus shifts to Bobby Deol's character, and Deol delivers a powerful performance that is sure to leave you speechless. Deol is able to convey a wide range of emotions, and he is particularly effective in the film's more emotional scenes. The second half of Animal is not as action-packed as the first half, but it is still an engaging and rewarding watch.Technical BrillianceThe technical aspects of Animal are top-notch. The film is beautifully shot and edited, and the soundtrack is powerful and evocative. The special effects are also impressive, and they add to the film's overall impact.A Must-Watch for Fans of Male-Centric Action FilmsAnimal is a film that will not be for everyone. However, for fans of action films and male-centric narratives, it is a must-see. The film is well-made and entertaining, and it features strong performances from its cast. If you are looking for a film that will leave you breathless, then Animal is the film for you.Here are some additional thoughts on the film:The film is not without its flaws. Some viewers may find the plot to be predictable, and the film's violence may be too much for some.However, the film's strengths outweigh its weaknesses. The performances are excellent, the action sequences are thrilling, and the film is overall a very entertaining watch.If you are a fan of action films or male-centric narratives, then Animal is a film that you should definitely check out.I hope this review has been helpful.",positive
7,The violence hasn't gone too far :),"Firstly, this movie is directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga. It features such a big star cast, and it revolves around the bonding between a father and son. After Kabir Singh, this was a big hit for Vanga. The way he presented actors like Ranbir Kapoor or Bobby Deol on screen is worth the money, coupled with a banging background score. Personally, I found this movie amazing, especially the dedication Ranbir Kapoor put into his character. Overall, this movie is a must-watch, mate!And yes, its songs are really good. I personally liked them, and when it's Arijit Singh, the enjoyment is guaranteed, right? By the way, the entire movie on one side and the interval block on the other, people were screaming like crazy.....
This movie has received an A certificate, and rightfully so because there's not just a little violence; a lot is happening. When you watch the movie, you'll understand, and don't take your mom and dad with you-it can have a significant impact.""",positive
8,Best Action Movie Ever,"At its core, Animal is a rollercoaster of emotions, painting a gritty and raw portrayal of the characters' psychological turmoil. Ranbir Kapoor delivers a compelling performance, portraying Vijay's emotional journey with depth and conviction. His portrayal of a man consumed by a quest for retribution and grappling with his inner conflicts is truly captivating.The movie doesn't shy away from its darker elements, depicting raw violence, intense confrontations, and a narrative soaked in the shades of grey within human relationships. However, some critics and audiences found fault in the film's excessive portrayal of violent masculinity and its treatment of certain themes, labeling it as misogynistic.Visually, the film is striking, with cinematography that effectively captures the intensity and mood of the narrative. The director's ability to create a tense and emotionally charged atmosphere is commendable, keeping the audience engaged throughout the narrative's twists and turns.",positive
1,One of the worst movie seen!,"The product before us is problematic not only because of unjustified gore, most viewers including myself have seen fair share of gore, but creative liberty can't be justification for such a movie! Needless sexual perversions shown can only be justified by the director's need and want to justify his own perversions.. normalising for the world.. one person killing three hundred people single handedly leaves one speechless! Hard earned money and precious time should not be wasted on such movies! And all the toxic masculinity is not an imagination, there has been a deliberate attempt to justify it, glorify it and make it appear cool. The excuse that a movie's characters need not be morally correct always, again in the name of creative liberty is just not holding it enough!",negative
10,Can't give 0 stars so giving 10 to show how bad it is.,"In terms of narrative as well as action and character development, this film is truly unique. I really enjoyed this movie because it is straightforward and presents everything in its proper light. Ranbir does a great job of capturing the darkness that all people harbor, which only serves to highlight what a person is capable of when they put their whole heart and mind into something. When discussing the roles, Rashmika Mandana and Ranbir Kapoor were spot on. Anil Kapoor and the rest of the cast performed exceptionally well. The film is brought to life by the amazing director. I was captivated to my seat the entire time I watched this movie. The film is a box office success.",positive
9,"Animal is an absolute massy, entertaining and extremely violent thriller","Animal is an absolute massy, entertaining and extremely violent thriller which doesn't believe in conforming to the norms. The bloodshed isn't for the weak hearted to watch, so practice caution if you decide to watch it because there's a lot of it, and you might not be able to take that much.At 3 hours 22 minutes, one of the longest films I watched in a very long time, Animal is determined to give you a headache as the high-pitched dialogues are certain to pierce through your ears causing discomfort. Then, there are portions you wish were underplayed - visually and verbally.For instance, multiple references to male's pubic hair as a symbol of manhood isn't too pleasant. Or when Ranbir is discussing about his sex life with a psychologist post his accident. The screenplay that Sandeep has co-written with Pranay Reddy Vanga and Saurabh Gupta takes care of all gripping elements and ensures that each frame offers a cinematically visual treat. But, amid all this logic takes a backseat, and the story is continuously being dragged, especially in the second half.That being said, Ranbir is in top form, and becomes Sandeep Reddy Vanga Vanga's Animal in its truest sense. He is a fine blend of vulnerability and villainous traits. He instantly makes you fall for him, and even when he is getting shot or being punched in the face, you feel bad for him, and never wish for him to be dead.",positive
9,For all those Critics out there.,"The storyline revolves around a son's deep love and admiration for his father, a theme that ironically leads to conflict between them. This father-son bond is central to the film's narrative, which delves into themes of crime and revenge, creating a ferocious and intense tale.Ranbir Kapoor, in the role of the son, demonstrates his acting versatility, while Rashmika Mandanna adds depth to the film's narrative with her performance. The ensemble cast, including Anil Kapoor, Bobby Deol, and Tripti Dimri, contribute significantly to the film's rich tapestry of characters, each adding unique dimensions to the story.Ultimately, this is Sandeep's tale, a vivid tapestry of character and narrative that transcends mere justification. This film is a bold stroke of artistry, not a courtroom for moral judgment. It's cinema in its purest form - a thrilling ride meant to captivate and entertain.",positive
10,Very bad film!,"Seriously bad film, why films like these are made in a socialist, secular and modern nation which was made in 1947 even after a day later than its neighbor countries that were dissected from it. This film shows the hypocrisy in the society that gives religious freedom just in name so that it can be politically correct but steals the basic decency of letting people follow every aspect of their religion on the basis of right to live. Let people force their thoughts on another because it's their right to practice religion and the religion orders them to force their ideology on others and if they do not accept take heavy toll in terms of money, land, women and spit in their mouths while doing so, if this act of peace is not accepted just exterminate them.

1,This movie is proof that Bollywood needs better writing,"I've never written an IMDB review but this movie was so bad I felt compelled to write a review. The movie normalizes toxic bravado, misogyny, domestic abuse and unnecessary gore. First half was hard to follow and unconvincing. RKs love for his father didn't make sense, he's upset that the husband doesn't consider her opinions as an equal but he also treats the sisters like they shouldn't have opinions. Second half was even worse, fightings scenes are so unnecessary I could literally call how it was gonna go. The story telling was incoherent at best. Overall, wanted to puke after and felt bad for the state of Bollywood.",negative
1,Worst,"Worst movie ever watched just totally money wasted no ethnicity and public awareness only crime.the character is tatti just murdering people only doing nothing else , just all this is freaking made opinions and thought of the director no good story line and the worst part is that it only diminished the mind of people and their understanding about the thought for the female this movie is just an other backward and false thoughts to create a messed up society, movie is just made on the purpose to show masculinity of man power and nothing else the wrong thoughts and messages were displayed just to evolve violence.",negative
1,Total loss of time,"I dont know from where to start, but will try to be concise.The two initial subjects are very interesting ( the relation father and son) and the Alpha Male / and the power equation within society. However, the movie looses the track and looses it completely around the intermission. The movie is a copy paste of different movies such as the Godfather, scarface, Alpha etc but in a very bad copy. Ranbir is talks more about being an alpha than really being one. Lots of talking, shouting, off showing but totally empty. The guy is killing 300 men Alone while having a boysband behind him singing like non alpha men. Anyways, a total waste of tume and total out of subject.",negative
4,Extremely violent,"It was too violent and so much bloodshed was there. Unnecessary blood was seen in the movie.Language was vulgar and abusive. The plot was weak and unconvincing. So much violence cannot be justified even in family enmities.The acting was good by Ranbir Kapoor and Bobby deol but characters were very creepy. Female characters were better.Movies should be watched for entertainment and fun and not for seeing such creepy things. Cannot be watched with family .Even watching alone is a torture.Feel bad for people who beared it in cinemas.Not recommended .It glorifies violence,abuse and is not justified.",negative
1,BAWASEER,"One of the worst movies I have watched so far.No story, no drama, no suspense, only Papa Papa Papa.This is slow poison to youth. Highly 18+ to even watch with your brother.Movie is full of sex and lust without any reason.I made the worst decision to watch this crap in the cinema, hope I threw my money away in deep dea instead of watchging this movie.You have to be mentally unstable to like this movie, any normal person who has good taste in movie and storyline, would reject this movie in the very first 15 minutes.I hope Ranbir Kapoor would choose some sensible movies next time.This one is too bad, literraly the worst.",negative
1,"Bad plot, no storyline, worst characters","The movie in question not only falls short in various fundamental aspects but is also highly overrated, adding to the disappointment for viewers. Despite its acclaim, the storyline lacks coherence, making it challenging to follow and engage with. The dialogues, a crucial element of storytelling, lack creativity and substance, failing to breathe life into the characters. Nonrealistic scenarios further diminish the film's authenticity, challenging viewers to suspend disbelief. The plot, touted as a strong point, is one of the weakest links, devoid of ingenuity and failing to captivate the audience's interest. This, coupled with characters suffering from poor development, contributes to an unsatisfactory cinematic experience. The movie's overrated status raises questions about the criteria for acclaim, as it ultimately proves to be a waste of time for those seeking a meaningful and immersive viewing experience.",negative
6,Proves Bollywood still dont know how to make Proper Action movie,"Director tried to make a movie near to John wick. Film shows so much violence that even John wick violence look family oriented. John wick action was based on tricks, ammunations and tactics. But here it focused only in blood thirst and unwanted excess emotion flow. Only Positive attribute was murdering bobby deol using knife which was totally real life oriented action and some small details like husband wife relations personal talks which were down to indian family.Over un necessary emotions and over focused violence are the downfalls of this movie.Characters played by ranvir kapoor is admiring along with rashmika.",negative
1,"Degradation of brain levels, waste of time, senseless","Is it what the movie markers want their children to do drink, smoke and do criminal activities. What is the movie trying to portray, what nonsense source of entertainment is this. Is sensor board doing its job or not? The story writer has got no sense about what to write and what not. Can't they make simple good movie having good message in it. These people should learn from hollywood or from marathi movies that what a really movie means. Can't they just make a documentary which is informative and adds something to brain or do comedy movie which has no valgur language. People should not idolise these type of moive makers.",negative

1,This movie is not time appropriate.,"The anticipation is notably absent when engaging with this content. It leans excessively into a macho ethos, perpetuating a misogynistic undertone that significantly detracts from its appeal. The portrayal of various elements within is alarmingly inaccurate, contributing to an overall negative experience. There seems to be a lack of nuance and sensitivity in depicting different aspects, leading to an unsatisfactory engagement. This absence of diversity and inclusivity hampers the content's potential to resonate with a broader audience. In essence, the overly macho and misogynistic tone, coupled with the skewed representation, renders this offering unappealing, leaving the viewer with little to look forward to in terms of a positive and enriching experience.",negative
4,Animal: A disappointing action drama,"Animal is a movie that has some good action and emotion, but it is ruined by its length, and boredom. The movie is about Ranvijay Singh (Ranbir Kapoor), a son of a rich businessman, who becomes obsessed with protecting his father from his enemies. The movie is too long, with a runtime of over three hours. The movie does not develop the characters well, especially the women, who are either props or victims. The movie also has many unnecessary and graphic sex scenes, which add nothing to the story or the characters. The movie has a decent climax, but it is too little too late. The movie should have been between two hours to two hours and twenty minutes, not more than that.",negative
1,Lower than 1 star,"What was this movie (it's difficult to call it even a movie). The story, the reason for the erratic nature of the lead actor is so baseless. What type of drug was consumed by the writer/director/editor of the movie when they were putting this together? We'll never know why anyone decided to even make this film. It's the worst movie I have seen and my brothers, sister, sister-in-law and husband had to endure this movie (we did skip tons of scenes in to keep our sanity) just because I thought Ranbir kapoor acted well even though everything else about the movie would get multiple negative stars if that was an option.",negative
1,Slap on creativity,Horrible movie. Don't know why Ranbir agreed to do it. Inot even one time watch and are not worth watching again.

2,No words. I'm going wild like an animal.,"This movie was a curve ball. There is not doubt Ranbir's acting was amazing. I couldn't separate him and his character. His rage felt so raw, so real. The film also had other great actors like Anil Kapoor and Bobby Deol who fit their roles really well.The fact of their acting aside, this movie was absolute trash. The storyline was quite terrible and there were intensive holes in the plot. The film was quite graphic and not in a Tarantino way- but more so written by a 12 year old boy way. Yes there were some humorous moments but in summary it was not enjoyable to watch. Save three hours of your life. Seriously. Some scenes were so terrible it almost felt satirical.",negative
5,It's all over Ranbir's one man show,"Sandeep Reddy Vanga took his own time to get into the story, first half is good with the great interval block but the movie goes wrong in second half there are few good movements but it felt bored at many places
Positives:
1. One and only ranbir kapoor
2. Other actors performance especially rashmika mandana
3. Music and songs
4. Editing and some great shots
5. Cinematography
Negatives:
1. Father son scenes didn't come out as expected
2. Most of the 2 half
3. Bobby had very less screen presence
4 . Drama lacks
5 . Too many cinematic liberties
Atlast, SRV impressed as with his pathbreaking writing with Arjun Reddy but in animal somehow he failed as writer but still you should give a try for few great movements.",negative
1,Worst Movie ever made,This movie is a disaster.psycopathic movie. The dialogues were so pathetic and sadistic. I am regretting why i watched this movie. Its so disturbing and waste of time. I have given 1 star but it deserves negative rating. The way the movie portrays a man its just not right. Both the hero and villen have same character. Such a nonsense movie. The censor board of india is sleeping. How they are passing these type of content is very pathetic. New generation will learn not to respect women and treat them as objects. Just like the character zoya was used as an object. I would urge everyone not to watch this movie. And also i am not going to watch any movie of Sandeep Reddy vanga.,negative
1,A Menagerie of Mediocrity,"I recently had the unfortunate experience of watching what can only be described as the cinematic equivalent of a zoo's closed exhibit - an animal movie that left me questioning not only my choice of entertainment but the very concept of filmmaking itself. From the outset, it became apparent that the filmmakers had a checklist of clichés to adhere to: a predictable storyline featuring anthropomorphic animals with one-dimensional personalities, a forced message about unity and friendship, and a soundtrack so uninspiring it made elevator music sound like a symphony. The visual effects were reminiscent of a bygone era, failing to deliver the realism one expects from modern CGI. It was as if the budget for special effects had been allocated to the catering rather than enhancing the on-screen fauna. The animals' lip-syncing was so out of sync that I half-expected a dubbed voiceover to start explaining the plot. The dialogue was cringe-worthy, with puns and jokes that not even a dad at his most desperate would utter. The attempts at humor were so feeble that the only laughter in the theater came from a group of teenagers mocking the film's lackluster attempts at wit. The characters, both human and animal, were so devoid of depth that even a puddle seemed profound in comparison. Their motivations were as transparent as the hastily written script, leaving no room for audience engagement or emotional investment. In a desperate bid to tug at heartstrings, the movie employed every conceivable trope, from a contrived love story between two mismatched species to a tear-jerking farewell scene that fell flat, leaving the audience more bored than moved. In conclusion, this animal movie is a chaotic safari through the depths of cinematic despair. It's a film that not only insults the intelligence of its audience but also tarnishes the reputation of the entire genre. Save yourself the agony and spend your time on something more intellectually stimulating - perhaps watching paint dry would be a more fulfilling use of your precious hours.",negative
6,One time watchable,"A routine story line and also same fightings but we can praise Ranbir's acting along with Anil Kapoor. Just some part is quite best and different. We can also praise the screenplay and there is too much of violence in this movie,and also in part 2 there may be too much of violence it's quite same in all old movies.The story line we can see in all Indian old movies as something in past incidents of a person effect his future and their sons may kill the enemies who want to revenge on that person. This Story line we can see in all Telugu movies and also in these days we are seeing same routine fighting movies and also spy movies.",negative

10,Absolutely brilliant,"Great storyline, the best Film for 2023 not your usual rubbish must see great acting from Bobby and Ranbir. I have seen the film four times. Excellent. Can't wait to see it on Netflix going again for the fifth time. Not your usual love story. Brilliant film excellent Film. What else can I say these two are brilliant actors and the choreograph is just awesome. Brilliant songs, well done bprak for your excellent and beautiful songs. Fighting scenes just awesome. Big credit to all the actors and all the producers directors and the casting crew can't wait for number two will be brilliant like the first one.",positive
1,"Core concept okayish, misogyny unwarranted","Good - Ranbir acting, different looks he portrays, unique concept of exploring a emotionally charged and obsessive relationship between father and son, theme songBad - unnecessary and dragged double meaning jokes, the length of the movie, toxic masculinity.Worst - Extreme misogyny. Without the misogyny, the main plot could have floated easily. Not just the main character, every male character is heavily misogynist. The misogyny served no purpose to the plot, it just seems director's ugly fantasy to treat women as garbage. It seems with Kabir Singh's massive success, he realised people enjoy this sadistic pleasure of treating women like dirt and he 10x'ed Kabir Singh. The only solace Rashmika's charcter at least divorces him for infidelity.",negative
1,Worst film ever!,"There is no way, I can recommend this film to anyone, a complete mayhem. These people have no shame, zero moral values here, and they will be disappointed to learn that even real animals don't behave this way, the title itself actually disrespected loving and kind animals. I wonder why even some the of senior actors wanted to be part this total garbage, this is not art.Worst part of this is that it made Punjabis/ ""Singh's"" look really bad, this film should have been banned and shame on the censor board for allowing it to pass.Hopefully, common sense will prevail and the sequel will be abandoned.",negative
8,Something different from Bollywood,"Different concept offered . The movie had a simple plot ... had some masala elements but they were easy to digest as the story was well connected, the characters of anil kapoor and rashmika were also explored properly giving a good highlight. Its eventually a good to great movie to watch. Ranbir kapoor is the star of the movie and keeps the long movie in grip.Its much better from movies i can see these days in bollywood specifically pathaan jawaan or tiger which had no story , no plot connections and absolute bad acting . This movie actually makes sense of the characters and had a good direction.",positive
1,Garbage,"""Animal"" proudly flaunts its disregard for decency with gratuitous scenes of strong language, unwanted smooching, and obscenity. It's a film that shamelessly panders to the lowest common denominator, leaving audiences wondering if they accidentally stumbled into a dimension where filmmaking standards cease to exist.Save yourself from this cinematic catastrophe. If you have 3.5 hours to spare, spend it in any other way imaginable-perhaps attempting to paint drying walls or engaging in a riveting staring contest with your furniture. Anything would be a more rewarding use of your time than subjecting yourself or your loved ones to the abomination that is ""Animal.""",negative
1,Mr. Director think it is magnificent but I think it's a piece of crap :o,"Sensor board should've banned the movie not for how offensive it is, rather how primitive purposeless and unengaging it is. The movie is dull and does not have any flavor and by the end of the movie it makes you think staring at a wall for the movie length might've been better. I do wonder how did they even manage to make a three and a half hour movie from a subjectless script.The movie might be recognised only for the performance by Ranbir Kapoor and i have to say there was more room for improvement had the character been written more meticulously. Father was the worst part of the movie hands down, it was like having a statue instead, since there is absolutely no contribution to the plot else than his existence. No offense to the actor playing the role since the character has been written this way.This pathetic role was only succeeded by the wife. Oh man, I believe wife did have a lot of impact on the movie. Or should I say could have. The actress portrayed the wife's role with such expressions that she reminds you of the stickman from the memes. The antagonist is hailed all over the internet, but I'd say he would've been amazing had he been on screen for a little more time and spoke a little more.It's a failed attempt at American psycho and fightclub.Lack of depth and intensity makes the character fall short of Patrick Bateman, lack of purpose, origin story and emotion proves the character falls short of being Rocky from KGF-1(KGF-2 was not a good movie).All the hate goes to the script writer, and the director. The only scene which was relevant to the movie was the last one where the lead actor confronts his father(although the credit scrolls is a better scene). The whole movie is absolute garbage that would make you loathe the art of movie making. There ain't any scene that moves you and the movie lacks proper romance, emotions don't make you feel a thing, comedy is vulgar, cheap and not funny.I hope the director makes time from writing awful scripts to go see a shrink and get some help. This is not just referring him as a misogynist but as person who lacks good thoughts and good ideas. And Mr. Delusional high-level testosterone, poetry is not for weak men, and poems do not talk about ""I'll bring the moon for you"" since they are not as shallow as your movie. Even if you knew a little about poetry you wouldn't have had made a bad movie. Poetry is used to eloquently express how a person feels so that it doesn't not become an infestation.This review does not allude the length of sexism portrayed in the movie. I wonder how long writing about that'll go.A pathetic, cheap, unengaging, brain-dead, poetry-less movie.",negative
8,Best of RK,"The movie have shown the best of RK so far. For the critics - there are movies with more violence & Sexual content then why animal ??? Look as a audiance enjoy 3.30 hrs & return that's it. There are plenty happening around you so before critisism just wash out what's bad around you then speak.Need to watch - Good movie better then jawan or pathaan. So let's enjoy.Good background music superb acting by RK & it shows the love of a son for his father. There are some Dialogues , scenes which might be disturbing but at last it's a movie which have been made for just entertainment not to hurt anyone's personal feels. So do watch as a movie & Enjoy.",positive
1,"""Bloodstains of Discontent: A Disastrous Dive into Family Drama and Vengeful Chaos in 'Animal Movie'""","Movie attempts to explore the complex dynamics of a strained father-son relationship, but falls short with a poorly executed plot. The narrative takes a dark turn as the protagonist's quest for revenge descends into an unrealistic and disturbing bloodbath.

8,THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR THE FAINT HEARTED,"The movie has a roller coaster of emotions going on. Despite this dad, son saga being about 3.5hrs long it's exceptionally gripping. If you're looking for reality, or relatability, this movie isn't for you. Most aspects are fictional and should not be taken as an example of a toxic lifestyle etc - alike Kabir Singh.If you love action movies, this movie will not disappoint you - with its great scene choreograph and amazing background score and not to mention the outstanding acting. Ranbir, throughout was a great fit for this role and has completely nailed the character. Rashmika and Anil Kapoor also do not fail to impress you. And on top of this Bobby Deol - the most unexpected actor has truly made a comeback with his scenes. One thing I would've wished for would be to give him more screen time - because his character and acting could've have shone more.You might feel the movie a little long but I think Sandeep - the director is looking to build a much larger movie with this concept hence the lengthy movie.Overall, if you're faint hearted and believe everything can become toxic then this movie isn't for you *period* If you love action, romance and great acting and would like to enjoy your evening then please do not miss this banger!",positive
1,Provocative elements seemed aimed at shock value rather than enhancing the story,"Despite its box office success, ""Animal"" has been a polarizing film, drawing criticism for its depiction of toxic masculinity and glorification of violence. Critics have pointed out that the film, while attempting to weave a complex narrative around familial bonds and revenge, often indulges in excessive brutality and a problematic portrayal of its characters, overshadowing its cinematic merits. The mixed reviews highlight a divide between the film's commercial achievements and its reception in critical circles.Upon viewing ""Animal,"" the film's portrayal of edginess felt more contrived than genuine, diminishing any deep narrative connection. The introduction of provocative elements seemed aimed at shock value rather than enhancing the story, leading to a fragmented viewing experience. This superficial approach, coupled with the use of controversial imagery, left me pondering the film's ultimate purpose and creative direction. The absence of genuine thematic exploration resulted in an experience that seemed devoid of substance and coherence, raising questions about the effectiveness of its narrative strategies.",negative

Storyline was ok, but could have been better, it seems that after intermission a complete different movie starts. Still, the good directing made this movie way beyond average bollywood movie.
